The average eighth-grade class size in the state is 26. If the students in Mr. Camp's class are representative of students in the state's eighth-grade classes and there are 1,800 eighth-grade classes in the state, which of the following best estimates the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have fewer than two siblings?", "choices": {"A": "16,200", "B": "23,400", "C": "30,600", "D": "46,800 Questions 23 and 24 refer to the following information."}, "answer": "C", "solution": "Choice $\\mathbf{C}$ is correct. It is given that $34.6 \\%$ of 26 students in Mr. Camp's class reported that they had at least two siblings. Since $34.6 \\%$ of 26 is 8.996 , there must have been 9 students in the class who reported having at least two siblings and 17 students who reported that they had fewer than two siblings. It is also given that the average eighth-grade class size in the state is 26 and that Mr. Camp's class is representative of all eighth-grade classes in the state. This means that in each eighth-grade class in the state there are about 17 students who have fewer than two siblings. Therefore, the best estimate of the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have fewer than two siblings is $17 \\times$ (number of eighth-grade classes in the state), or $17 \\times$ $1,800=30,600$Choice $A$ is incorrect because 16,200 is the best estimate for the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have at least, not fewer than, two siblings. Choice $B$ is incorrect because 23,400 is half of the estimated total number of eighth-grade students in the state; however, since the students in Mr. Camp's class are representative of students in the eighthgrade classes in the state and more than half of the students in Mr. Camp's class have fewer than two siblings, more than half of the students in each eighth-grade class in the state have fewer than two siblings, too. Choice $D$ is incorrect because 46,800 is the estimated total number of eighth-grade students in the state."}

Substituting 25 for $y$ in the equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ gives $25=(x-11)^{2}$.

Since both points of intersection have a $y$-coordinate of 25 , it follows that the two points are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$.

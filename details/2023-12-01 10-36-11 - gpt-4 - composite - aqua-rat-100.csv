The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

  B: 20/7
  C: 30/7
  D: 40/7
  E: 50/7
",,B,B,D,B,D,B,B,D,B,B,B,B,"The mixture contains 3kg sand and 7 kg clay.
For the mixture to be in equal quantities, there should be 2 kg of clay removed.
Clay and sand are in the ratio 7:3
So part of sand to be removed = 2*3/7 = 6/7
So total mixture to be removed = 2 + 6/7 = 20/7

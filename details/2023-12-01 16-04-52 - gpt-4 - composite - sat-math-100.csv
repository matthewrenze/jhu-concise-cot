Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
",,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,"Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The value of the camera equipment depreciates from its original purchase value at a constant rate for 12 years. So if $x$ is the amount, in dollars, by which the value of the equipment depreciates each year, the value of the camera equipment, in dollars, $t$ years after it is purchased would be $32,400-x t$. Since the value of the camera equipment after 12 years is $\$ 0$, it follows that $32,400-12 x=0$. To solve for $x$, rewrite the equation as $32,400=12 x$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 12 gives $x=2,700$. It follows that the value of the camera equipment depreciates by $\$ 2,700$ each year. Therefore, the value of the equipment after 4 years, represented by the expression $32,400-2,700(4)$, is $\$ 21,600$.Choice $A$ is incorrect. The value given in choice $A$ is equivalent to $\$ 2,700 \times 4$. This is the amount, in dollars, by which the value of the camera equipment depreciates 4 years after it is purchased, not the dollar value of the camera equipment 4 years after it is purchased. Choice $B$ is incorrect. The value given in choice $B$ is equal to $\$ 2,700 \times 6$, which is the amount, in dollars, by which the value of the camera equipment depreciates 6 years after it is purchased, not the dollar value of the camera equipment 4 years after it is purchased. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. The value given in choice $\mathrm{D}$ is equal to $\$ 32,400-\$ 2,700$. This is the dollar value of the camera equipment 1 year after it is purchased.",1,553,2665,3218,

  A: $x+2 y=a$

  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
",,A,A,A,A,A,C,A,A,A,A,A,A,"Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

Therefore a column of stacked one-cent coins that is 4 inches tall would contain slightly more than 50 one-cent coins. It can then be reasoned that because 8 inches is twice 4 inches, a column of stacked one-cent coins that is 8 inches tall would contain slightly more than twice as many coins; that is, slightly more than 100 one-cent coins. An alternate approach is to set up a proportion comparing the column height to the number of one-cent coins, or $\frac{3 \frac{7}{8} \text { inches }}{50 \text { coins }}=\frac{8 \text { inches }}{x \text { coins }}$, where $x$ is the number of coins in an 8-inch-tall column.

  D: 1.4
",,A,A,A,C,,A,,A,A,C,A,C,"Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. According to the given information, multiplying a tree species' growth factor by the tree's diameter is a method to approximate the age of the tree. A white birch with a diameter of 12 inches (or 1 foot) has a given growth factor of 5 and is approximately 60 years old. A pin oak with a diameter of 12 inches (or 1 foot) has a given growth factor of 3 and is approximately 36 years old. The diameters of the two trees 10 years from now can be found by dividing each tree's age in 10 years, 70 years, and 46 years, by its respective growth factor. This yields 14 inches and $15 \frac{1}{3}$ inches. The difference between $15 \frac{1}{3}$ and 14 is $1 \frac{1}{3}$, or approximately 1.3 inches.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect and a result of incorrectly calculating the diameters of the two trees in 10 years.",0,543,1778,2321,

It's given that the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year for 10 years.

The total of Ken's earnings, in dollars, for the week will be $10 x+80$. He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings each week, so this week he will save $0.9(10 x+80)$ dollars. The inequality $0.9(10 x+80) \geq 270$ represents the condition that he will save at least $\$ 270$ for the week. Factoring 10 out of the expression $10 x+80$ gives $10(x+8)$.

It's given that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: the inequality $120 a+100 b \leq 1,100$ represents this situation. It's also given that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages: the inequality $a+b \geq 10$ represents this situation. Values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and 100-pound packages the helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, $a$, in the helicopter, the number of 100-pound packages, $b$, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing $b$ in terms of $a$ in the second inequality yields $b \geq 10-a$, so the minimum value of $b$ is equal to $10-a$. Substituting $10-a$ for $b$ in the first inequality results in $120 a+100(10-(A)\leq 1,100$.

The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$.

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.

The linear function that represents the relationship will be in the form $r(p)$ $=a p+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $r(p)$ is the monthly rental price, in dollars, of a property that was purchased with $p$ thousands of dollars. According to the table, $(70,515)$ and $(450,3,365)$ are ordered pairs that should satisfy the function, which leads to the system of equations below.$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}70 a+b=515 \\450 a+b=3,365\end{array}\right.$$Subtracting side by side the first equation from the second eliminates $b$ and gives $380 a=2,850$; solving for $a$ gives $a=\frac{2,850}{380}=7.5$. Substituting 7.5 for $a$ in the first equation of the system gives $525+b=515$; solving for $b$ gives $b=-10$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation $\frac{x}{x-3}=x$by $x-3$ yields $x=x(x-3)$. Applying the distributive property of multiplication to the right-hand side of the equation $x=x(x-3)$ yields $x=x^{2}-3 x$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides of this equation yields $0=x^{2}-4 x$. Factoring $x$ from both terms of $x^{2}-4 x$ yields $0=x(x-4)$. By the zero product property, the solutions to the equation $0=x(x-4)$ are $x=0$ and $x-4=0$, or $x=4$. Substituting 0 and 4 for $x$ in the given equation yields $0=0$ and $4=4$, respectively. Since both are true statements, both 0 and 4 are solutions to the given equation.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from a sign error. Choice $C$ is incorrect and may result from an error in factoring. Choice D is incorrect and may result from not considering 0 as a possible solution.",1,524,3507,4031,

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
",,A,A,A,A,D,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,"Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is correct. If a system of two linear equations has no solution, then the lines represented by the equations in the coordinate plane are parallel. The equation $k x-3 y=4$ can be rewritten as $y=\frac{k}{3} x-\frac{4}{3}$, where $\frac{k}{3}$ is the slope of the line, and the equation $4 x-5 y=7$ can be rewritten as $y=\frac{4}{5} x-\frac{7}{5}$, where $\frac{4}{5}$ is the slope of the line. If two lines are parallel, then the slopes of the line are equal. Therefore, $\frac{4}{5}=\frac{k}{3}$, or $k=\frac{12}{5}$. (Since the $y$-intercepts of the lines represented by the equations are $-\frac{4}{3}$ and $-\frac{7}{5}$, the lines are parallel, not identical.)Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may be the result of a computational error when rewriting the equations or solving the equation representing the equality of the slopes for $k$.",1,569,2910,3479,

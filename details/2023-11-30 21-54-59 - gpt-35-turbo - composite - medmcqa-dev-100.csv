The allantois is not functional in humans and degenerates to form the median umbilical ligament in the adult.
As the amnion expands, it pushes the vitelline duct, connecting stalk, and allantois together to form the primitive umbilical cord.
The definitive umbilical cord at term is pearl-white, 1–2 cm in  diameter,  50–60  cm  long, eccentrically  positioned,  and contains the right and left umbilical arteries, left umbilical vein, and mucus connective tissue (Wharton’s jelly).

",,B,B,B,B,,B,B,B,B,B,B,C,"Ricketts’ E line:
R. M. Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose–chin line as a reference point. These values are for Caucasians and clearly cannot be applied to all races.

Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound. Coagulant fixatives: Both organic and non-organic solutions may coagulate proteins making them insoluble. Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)/formaldehyde/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin",1,504,2340,2844,

Block the secretion of TSH by pituitary directly --> major action
Block the secretion of TRH by hypothalamus (TRH stimulates the secretion of TSH by pituitary)


In primary hypothyrodism, T4 and T3 are not produced or produced in low concentration by thyroid. This results in abolition of negative feedback on TSH secretion. Thus, there is elevated TSH and pituitary can become hyperplastic to produce more TSH.
In pituitary cause of hypothyroidism (secondary hypothyroidism) both TSH and Thyroid hormone (T4, T3) are low as pituitary does not secrete TSH and TSH is the major stimulation for production of T4 and T3.

About option d

TSH resistance can also produce same picture i.e. raised TSH and low T4 with pituitary swelling.
There is thyroid insensitivity to TSH which results in hypothyroidism (1T4 and T3). Because of reduced thyroid hormone feedback, TSH is markedly elevated.

Metabolic syndrome (Formerly known as syndrome x) can dramatically increase your risk of serious health problems, such as diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes yet often people don't even know what it is.
Metabolic syndrome is generally defined as a cluster of risk factors, including high blood sugar, extra abdominal fat, high blood pressure, and unhealthy cholesterol levels.
Insulin resistance. Insulin is used to metabolize glucose. In people with insulin resistance, there is resistance against insulin action, due to which the body keeps making more and more of it to cope with the rising level of glucose. Eventually, this can lead to diabetes.",1,503,2663,3166,

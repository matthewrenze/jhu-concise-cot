### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: We are told that it is not within the "province of woman," to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a "political question," and we are "stepping out of our  sphere," when we take part in its discussion. It is nottrue that it is merely a political question, it is likewise a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into thehome-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to unrequited toil-whether he shall walk erect in the dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckonedamong the beasts which perish - whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or another's-whether his child shall receive the protection of its natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest ofthe master may dictate $\_\ldots$ these considerations are all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude, merely a "political question," and one in which woman "can take no part without losingsomething of the modesty and gentleness which are her most appropriate ornaments"? May not the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" exist with an upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart isopen to the claims of humanity, or less modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?By the Constitution of the United States, the  whole physical power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic insurrections, and should the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the North are bound to make common cause with the 40 tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet, every effort on the part of the slave, for the attainment of his freedom. And when the father, husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the unholy warfare, "to become the 45 executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands,"1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this subject? Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and50 their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she55 will not be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the cry of political question.But admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not60 permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle, and of the present hour? May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the 65 earth? Must we witness "the headlong rage or heedless folly," with which our nation is rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its downward course? Shall we silently behold the land which we love with all the heart-warm affection of70 children, rendered a hissing and a reproach throughout the world, by this system which is already tolling the death-bell of her decease among the nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright75 prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely our hearts cling to "our altars and our homes," the80 more fervent are our aspirations that every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom85 God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our course, then, still be onward!

  - She presents the argument that the issue of slavery affects not only politics but also justice, humanity, morality, and religion, and has consequences that touch the daily lives of many people. 

Thought:
  - Smith addresses the idea that women can be involved in the discussion of slavery without losing their gentleness, modesty, or femininity.
  - She argues that women are affected by the issue of slavery as it pertains to their homes and families and thus they have the right to engage with the topic.
  - In response to the argument that the topic of slavery is a political one, Smith asks whether women should not express concern about the welfare of their country and its citizens.

Analysis:
  - Choice A (Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity) is the closest answer, as Smith argues that women should be able to engage in discussions about slavery and the welfare of their country while still maintaining their modesty and gentleness.
  - Choice B (Adhering to personal morality while being politically neutral) is not accurate; Smith is arguing that women should engage in the political discussion surrounding slavery.

  C: Contributing to their family's financial security while meeting social expectations talks about playing a role in the family's financial well-being while also adhering to the societal norms placed upon women.
  D: Resisting calls for war while still opposing slavery discusses a more active, pacifist role against slavery.

Thought:
  In the passage, Smith argues that women must not ignore the inhumane practices of slavery and should extend support to the oppressed, while criticizing the notion that such views would diminish women's modesty and gentleness. She further highlights that women are affected by these issues directly when their male family members leave to suppress insurrections. Smith's argument implies that women can involve themselves in issues related to humanity and justice, not just politics, without compromising their femininity.

Criticism:
  The passage doesn't discuss the financial security of the family or provide strong examples of resisting calls for war. Therefore, options C and D do not represent Smith's argument. The discussion is not about adhering to personal morality while being politically neutral, but rather actively engaging in discussions related to slavery and humanitarian principles. Thus, option B is also not suitable.

Conclusion:
  Option A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity best represents Smith's argument in the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
The passage discusses the notion that women should not engage in discussions on slavery as it is deemed a "political question" and that they are "stepping out of their sphere." Smith challenges this idea by arguing that the issue of slavery goes beyond politics and involves questions of justice, humanity, morality, and religion. She believes that women have a role in discussing and addressing the matter and engaging in such activity does not necessarily make them less gentle or modest. 

Thought:
Smith emphasizes that the subject of slavery involves much more than just political issues, and she stresses the importance of women participating in such discussions.
For each choice:
  A: Women can both act according to humanitarian principles and preserve their femininity, as Smith argues that feeling for the liberation of enslaved people does not compromise feminine modesty and gentleness.
  B: Adhering to personal morality while being politically neutral is not mentioned in the passage. Smith is focusing on women engaging in discussions about slavery rather than tiptoeing around it.
  C: Contributing to their family's financial security while meeting social expectations is not a focal point of the passage. The discussion is centered around the involvement of women in matters related to slavery.
  D: Resisting calls for war while still opposing slavery is not the main argument in this passage. Smith is pointing out the importance of women being involved in discussing and addressing slavery.

Criticism:
  The choice that best aligns with the passage's argument is A: Acting according to humanitarian principles while preserving their femininity. The other choices are not directly addressed or are only tangentially related to the passage's topic.

  In the passage, Smith discusses the role of women in the discussion of slavery.
  A: Smith suggests that women can be gentle, modest, and still engage with humanitarian issues.
  B: The passage discusses women being involved in political or social issues, not staying neutral.

The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect
Question: The passage most strongly suggests that if collisionalerosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient toexplain the situation discussed in the passage, then,as a result, scientists would expect to find that
Choices:
  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
  B: the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
  C: iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
  D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Response 0:
Recited knowledge:
  The passage discusses the missing mantle problem and provides reasons why iron fragments might survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart. It also describes the idea that differentiated asteroids were relatively rare to begin with and none have survived apart from Vesta, which has only a single large crater on its surface.

Thought:
  The passage mentions that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation, intact differentiated asteroids would be very rare. Vesta is one example with more than 300 miles diameter. It raises the question of how primitive asteroids survived when almost none of the differentiated ones did. It also talks about the possibility that differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with.

Criticism:
  The information provided in the passage helps to understand the context of the choices given. Let's analyze each choice:
  A: Vesta is mentioned as possibly one of the few remaining differentiated asteroids. However, if there were originally more large differentiated asteroids in the belt, this statement would be true, but it doesn't necessarily follow from collisional erosion being sufficient.
  B: If collisional erosion were sufficient, the passage suggests that we might still find many primitive asteroids, which is in contradiction with this choice.
  C: The passage does not suggest a direct relationship between collisional erosion and the size of iron fragments. So, this choice doesn't seem to follow the passage meaning.
  D: If collisional erosion were sufficient to explain the situation, one could indeed expect there to be originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids since the differentiated asteroids were considered to be very rare and almost entirely destroyed.

Conclusion:
  Based on the information presented in the passage and the analysis of each choice, the statement that follows most strongly from the passage if collisional erosion were sufficient is "D: there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt."

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Recited knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and the asteroid belt. It explains how iron fragments might survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart due to factors like their location in the core, survivability in space, and the strength of iron compared to rock. However, the passage also questions how so many primitive asteroids survived when almost none of the differentiated ones did.

  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt. (Vesta is mentioned in the passage as an example of an intact differentiated asteroid).
  
  B: The passage states that the asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. (Primitive asteroids are described as the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are more common than differentiated mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids).
  
  C: Iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt. (The passage states that iron fragments are more resilient and have a higher chance of surviving compared to rocky fragments of the same size).

  D: There were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. (The passage does not directly make this claim, but it does discuss how differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with and that most of them might have been destroyed in violent collisions).

Thought:
  The question asks what the passage most strongly suggests if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage:
  
  A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt. (This choice suggests that if collisional erosion could explain the rarity of mantle rocks, then there would likely be more intact differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt).
  
  B: The asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. (This choice suggests that collisional erosion should have destroyed many primitive asteroids too, which contradicts the observation made in the passage that many primitive asteroids survived).
  
  C: Iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt. (This choice does not follow logically from the assumption that collisional erosion could explain the situation, as the passage notes that iron fragments tend to be more resilient and survive better than rocky fragments).
  
  D: There were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt. (This choice suggests a connection between the original asteroid populations and the explanations for the missing mantle problem, but does not directly address the consequences of collisional erosion being the main explanatory factor).

Criticism:
  A: This option is plausible since if collisional erosion were to explain the situation, then the expectation of more intact differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt is reasonable. This would mean that differentiated asteroids were destroyed in violent collisions, leading to a lower population of such asteroids.

  B: This option contradicts the passage, which says that many primitive asteroids survived. If collisional erosion could sufficiently explain the situation, then scientists should expect fewer primitive asteroids than are currently observed in the asteroid belt.
  
  C: This choice does not logically follow from the assumption that collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the situation as the passage explains that iron fragments are more resilient and have a higher chance of survival as compared to rocky fragments of the same size. The passage does not suggest that iron fragments should be smaller than rocky fragments if collisional erosion sufficiently explains the situation.
  
  D: This choice does not directly address the consequences of collisional erosion and is not a logical result or expectation if collisional erosion was the primary explanatory factor for the missing mantle problem.

  Based on the criticism, option A is the most plausible answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the missing mantle problem
- Vesta is a large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt
- Differentiated asteroids have iron cores and rocky mantles, while primitive asteroids are undifferentiated
- The passage suggests that if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the situation, there might be differences in the number or appearance of differentiated and primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt

Thought:
- Analyzing choice A, the passage does say that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem, we would expect more large differentiated asteroids like Vesta.
- Analyzing choice B, the passage states that primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, so if collisional erosion was the main factor at play, there might be fewer primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt than currently observed.
- Analyzing choice C, the passage does not directly suggest any correlation between the size of iron fragments and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt due to collisional erosion.
- Analyzing choice D, the passage implies that differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with, but it does not suggest that there were originally equal numbers of primitive and differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.

Criticism:
- Choice A correctly represents the passage's implication, as more large differentiated asteroids would be expected if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the missing mantle problem.
- Choice B is also consistent with the passage, as a greater collisional erosion effect would imply fewer primitive asteroids than currently observed.
- Choice C is not supported by the passage; the size of iron fragments and rocky fragments are not directly discussed together in relation to collisional erosion.
- Choice D is not a direct implication of the passage and appears unrelated to the amount of collisional erosion within the asteroid belt.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem."
- "Intact differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today," and Vesta is one such example.
- Primitive asteroids are more common, making up the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites.
- The strength of primitive asteroids is similar to mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
- Collisional erosion cannot solely explain the difference in survival rates between primitive and differentiated asteroids.
- Bottke and his team propose that parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the sun, with stronger iron objects surviving as the solar system aged.

Thought:
- If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt, on its own, were sufficient to explain the situation, then the difference in survival rates between primitive and differentiated asteroids would be better explained.
- The passage suggests that primitive asteroids and mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids have similar strength (making it confusing why there are many more primitive asteroids).
- In this hypothetical case, the number of primitive asteroids would be different than what we see today.
- Considering that, the scenario would reflect scientists' expectations about primitive and differentiated asteroid proportions if this hypothesis were true.

Criticism:
- The passage is consistent in its argument that collisional erosion within the asteroid belt is not sufficient to explain the entire situation.
- It offers an alternative explanation from Bottke and his colleagues that factors in proximity to the sun.
- Therefore, the question asks us to consider what would be expected if the collisional erosion theory were true.
- The most reasonable choice is influenced by the fact that primitive asteroids and mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids have similar strength, which is choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Collisional erosion relates to the breaking apart and wearing down of objects in space due to collisions.
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem."
- Primitive asteroids are no stronger than mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
- Vesta is mentioned as a large differentiated asteroid.
- The asteroid belt is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
- Differentiated bodies might have been relatively rare and have not survived.
- Bottke's team suggests that parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun and were scattered to the asteroid belt.

Thought:
- The question asks what would be expected if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt were sufficient to explain the discussed situation.
- Vesta is mentioned as a surviving differentiated asteroid, so option A would not be expected since Vesta is already acknowledged.
- Given Bottke's explanation, if the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt later, then the asteroid belt would probably still have many primitive asteroids (Option B would not be expected).
- The passage does not provide information regarding the size of iron fragments vs. rocky fragments in the asteroid belt (Option C is not strongly suggested).
- Option D focuses on the original number of primitive asteroids compared to the differentiated asteroids. If collisional erosion were sufficient to explain the situation, it would indicate that differentiated bodies were likely more rare to begin with, having a lower amount than primitive asteroids. Thus, option D would be expected.

Criticism:
- The thought process is logical and follows the information given in the passage.
- Option D considers the original amount of primitive vs. differentiated asteroids and is related to collisional erosion's ability to explain the situation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" - the rarity of mantle rocks in the meteorite collection and the asteroid belt.
- Collisional erosion is one possible explanation for the disparity between the number of primitive and differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.
- The passage suggests that if collisional erosion was the sole explanation, differentiated asteroids would be very rare in the asteroid belt.
- Vesta is an example of a differentiated asteroid with significant size in the asteroid belt.

Thought: 
- The passage questions how the primitive asteroids survived when almost none of the differentiated ones did.
- It also mentions that primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
- If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt were sufficient to explain the missing mantles, we would expect a different distribution or ratio of primitive to differentiated asteroids.

Criticism:
- The thought process seems reasonable and clearly involves the relevant concepts discussed in the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" which is a long-standing puzzle related to the rarity of mantle rocks in meteorites and asteroid belt.
- Differentiated asteroids have distinct core and mantle structures, where the core is typically iron and the mantle is rocky.
- Primitive asteroids are undifferentiated and mainly consist of chondritic meteorites, the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
- Gravitational perturbations scattered some differentiated fragments into the asteroid belt.
- The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation, then we could expect certain other effects.
Choices:
A: Vesta is not the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt.
B: The asteroid belt has far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does.
C: Iron fragments in the asteroid belt tend to be smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
D: There were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.

Thought:
- The passage mentions that differentiated asteroids like Vesta are rare and might be one of the few remnants of their kind.
- The passage suggests that primitive asteroids survived better than differentiated bodies due to their strength and other factors.
- According to the passage, iron fragments are stronger and tend to survive longer compared to rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
- The passage discusses the possibility that differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with.

Criticism:
- If collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the "missing mantle problem," then it would most likely lead to a scenario where there were fewer primitive asteroids in the asteroid belt. This is because the passage indicates that primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, so they should have been subjected to similar erosion rates. This corresponds to choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and how some asteroids have remained intact while others have eroded or been destroyed over time.
  A: Vesta is mentioned as a large differentiated asteroid that has survived with only one large crater on its surface.
  B: The passage states that primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  C: Iron fragments are mentioned as being much stronger than rocky fragments and are likely to survive longer in the asteroid belt.
  D: The passage states that differentiated bodies may have been relatively rare to begin with, and that their destruction by violent collisions could account for their rarity.

Thought:
  If collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists might expect to find the following consequences:
  
  A: Vesta might not be the only large differentiated asteroid in the asteroid belt. However, the passage does mention that intact differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today.
  B: The asteroid belt might have far fewer primitive asteroids than it currently does. This is because the passage is asking about what would happen if the collisional erosion were sufficient to explain the situation. If that were the case, then the amount of primitive asteroids should have been affected.
  C: Iron fragments being smaller than rocky fragments in the asteroid belt is not related to the consequences of "collisional erosion being sufficient to explain the situation."
  D: If collisional erosion were sufficient, then there would likely have been equal numbers of primitive and differentiated asteroids. However, the passage states that differentiated bodies may have been relatively rare to begin with, so this choice may not hold true.

Criticism:
  The passage questions why so many primitive asteroids survived when almost none of the differentiated ones did. In this context, a satisfactory answer should explain why primitive asteroids are more common if the collisional erosion were sufficient. Therefore, Choice B is the most relevant one.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" in the context of iron meteorites and differentiated asteroids.
- Iron meteorites are believed to come from the melted cores of asteroids.
- The mantles of these bodies are very rare in meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt.
- The passage mentions that primitive asteroids, which are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.

Thought:
- Collisional erosion within the asteroid belt is not sufficient to explain the situation as mentioned in the passage.
- The passage is questioning how primitive asteroids, with similar strength to mantle rocks, survived when almost none of the differentiated ones did.
- The passage does not discuss any particular expectations if collisional erosion was sufficient to explain the situation.

Criticism:
- The passage is offering an alternative explanation suggesting that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, and later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.

Answer: Based on the given choices and passage content, choice B can best be supported:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem."
- Iron meteorites come from the cores of asteroids that melted.
- Mantle rocks are rare in meteorite collections and asteroid belts.
- Iron fragments might survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
- Iron is in the core; rocky material is near the surface.
- Iron is stronger than rock.
- Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
- Vesta is mentioned as an intact differentiated asteroid.

Thought:
- The passage discusses the difference between iron fragments and rocky fragments in the asteroid belt.
- It talks about how iron fragments might survive better than rocky fragments due to their strength and position in an asteroid.
- The survival of primitive asteroids is also brought up as a point of discussion, questioning why they survived when differentiated ones did not.
- The passage suggests that perhaps differentiated bodies were rare to begin with or formed closer to the Sun.

Criticism:
- Carefully considering the knowledge, thoughts, and reasoning, it seems that each choice can be connected to various parts of the passage.
- We need to select the choice that would most strongly suggest that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation in the passage.

Analysis:
A: If collisional erosion were sufficient, then Vesta might not be the only large differentiated asteroid. However, the passage does not make a strong link between collisional erosion and Vesta not being the only large differentiated asteroid.
B: The passage discusses the different survival rates of primitive and differentiated asteroids, but it does not strictly imply that fewer primitive asteroids would exist if collisional erosion were sufficient.
C: The passage does not discuss the size differences between iron and rocky fragments related to collisional erosion.
D: If collisional erosion were sufficient, then it might be reasonable to assume that there were originally similar numbers of primitive asteroids and differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Many millennia before the invention of herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a  valuable part of an integrated weed-management 5 program. Although plowing kills standing weeds, farmers have long known that it often leads to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.Ecologists have shown that a farmer's field can have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter 10 buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow, which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil15 surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the surface where their germination is induced by exposure to sunlight?Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a 20 relatively simple experiment, they went to ten different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then25 exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples, weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a "light break," and this stimulates their 30 germination.More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen University in Germany reasoned that when farmers plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is35 turned over, and that this stimulates their germination. Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if40 farmers simply plowed their fields during the night, when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which photons hit the surface] is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. Although even under these conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike 45 each square millimeter of ground each second, this illumination is below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when he first came up with this idea because he assumed 50 that such a simple method of weed control as plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated 55 that the method can be effective.Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated threefold, at around midday and the other strip60 at night. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas 65 only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.This method of weed control is currently being used by several farmers in Germany. Because many of the same weed species that invade farmers' fields70 in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world, this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact, recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon, Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina support this idea.

Question: The passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been
Choices:
  A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.
  C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
  D: comparable to Hartmann's original projection.
Response 0:
Relevant Information:
- Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany. 
- No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. 
- More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.

Thought process:
- If crops were planted, they would have competed with the emerging weeds for resources like light, nutrients, and space.
- This might have affected the number of weeds that grew and therefore the percentage of the surface covered by weeds.

Evaluation:
A: Lower than the percentage that Hartmann found. This answer choice makes sense because the presence of crops could potentially decrease the percentage of the surface covered by weeds, due to competition for resources.
B: Higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted. There is no indication that planting crops would increase the percentage of surface covered by weeds.
C: Nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. The presence of crops might affect the results, but it's not necessarily nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
D: Comparable to Hartmann's original projection. The presence of crops might change the results, so saying that it would be comparable might not be accurate.

Given the thought process and evaluation, answer choice A seems to be the best answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
The passage states that in Hartmann's experiment, no crops were planted to "avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.". 
A: Lower than the percentage that Hartmann found suggests that planting crops would reduce weed coverage.
B: Higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted implies weed coverage would exceed expectations if crops were planted.
C: Nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine indicates that the effects of crop planting on weed coverage are unpredictable.
D: Comparable to Hartmann's original projection means that planting crops would not significantly change the weed coverage outcome.

Thought:
The passage outlines experiments where crops were not sown to avoid competition between the crops and emerging weeds. This setup allowed researchers to collect data solely on weed emergence.
The passage does not provide information on what would happen if crops were planted and how it may affect the percentage of weeds.

Criticism:
Although the passage does not provide explicit information about the effect of planting crops on weed coverage, Hartmann's experiment with no crops participation was deliberate. This suggests that adding crops might influence the percentage of weed coverage. Thus, option D: "comparable to Hartmann's original projection" is the least plausible answer. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- In Hartmann's experiment, no crops were planted to avoid competition with emerging weeds.
- The percentage of the surface covered with weeds was more than 80% in daylight-plowed fields and about 2% in night-plowed fields.
- Crops planted in the fields could affect weed growth due to competition.

Thought:
- If Seydel had planted wheat or corn, these crops would compete with weeds for resources.
- This competition might have an impact on the percentage of the surface covered with weeds.
- It is not mentioned that the impact would be positive or negative, but it implies that planting crops could lower weed growth due to competition.

Criticism:
- The passage suggests that planting crops could affect the percentage of weed growth in the field.
- We cannot determine the exact percentage, but it would likely be impacted.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Hartmann conducted an experiment with two agricultural strips to test the effect of plowing time on weed growth.
- One strip was plowed during the day, and the other at night.
- No crops were planted in the experiment to avoid competition with emerging weeds (lines 59-61).
- More than 80% of the surface plowed during the day was covered in weeds, while only around 2% of the surface plowed at night was covered in weeds (lines 64-65).

Thought:
- The question asks about the percentage of the surface covered with weeds if crops like wheat or corn were planted.
- The passage states that no crops were planted in the experiment to avoid competition with emerging weeds.
- Thus, planting crops could affect the percentage of surface covered in weeds.

Criticism:
- As crops like wheat or corn were not planted in the experiment, it is uncertain whether planting them would lead to lower or higher percentages of surface covered in weeds.
- However, since the reason for not planting them was to avoid competition with the emerging weeds during the experiment, we can infer that the competition would reduce the weed coverage in some way.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge and Thought:
- The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
- In Hartmann's experiment, one strip was cultivated during the day and the other strip at night.
- No crops were planted during these experiments to avoid competition with emerging weeds.
- Results showed that more than 80% of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds while only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
- As per the information provided, we can't be certain about what would happen if crops were planted. 

Criticism:
- We know that crops were avoided during the experiment to prevent competition with emerging weeds.
- We know the results of the experiment without crops.
- We don't have information on the percentage of surface covered with weeds if crops were planted.
- The information is insufficient to predict the percentage of surface covered with weeds if crops were planted.

The passage only indicates that crops were not planted to avoid competition with emerging weeds. It does not provide information regarding what the percentage covered with weeds would be if crops were planted. Thus, choosing the correct answer would be tough, but considering that competition between crops and weeds was mentioned, it may suggest that the presence of crops may have an impact on the weed cover percentages.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Relevant knowledge and context:

- Hartmann tested the idea with Karl Seydel's agricultural strips by plowing one strip at midday and the other one at night. 
- No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
- Results: more than 80% of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.

Thought process:
- The question is about the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds if Seydel had planted wheat or corn.
- Since crops were not planted in the pilot experiments to avoid competition with emerging weeds, planting wheat or corn might change the field conditions affecting weed growth.
- However, the passage does not provide information about how the presence of crops would specifically affect weed growth or how it compares to no-crop conditions.

Criticism:
- Given the passage's context, it is not clear how planting wheat or corn might change the weed percentage results.

Answer format: Answer("X")

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The experiment by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips, one during the day and the other at night.
  The purpose was to determine the effect of plowing time on weed growth.
  No crops were planted in the experiment to avoid competition with emerging weeds.
  More than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds.
  Only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.

Thought:
  If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips, it would introduce competition between the weeds and the crops.
  Since no crops were planted in the original experiment, we cannot be certain about the effect of crop planting on the percentage of the surface covered with weeds.
  However, eliminating competition from other plants was a focus in the original experiment.
  This suggests there may be some difference in weed growth when competition occurs by planting crops.

Criticism:
  There is no information provided in the passage that explicitly indicates what would happen to the percentage of surface covered by weeds if crops were planted.
  Additionally, there are no clues or suggestions about the exact effect of crop competition on weed growth.
  The available answer choices do not provide a definite answer or projection based on the passage.
  The best answer choice must be made using the given information.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- In Hartmann's experiment, two agricultural strips were plowed near Altershausen, Germany. One strip was plowed during the day, the other at night.
- No crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid competition with emerging weeds.
- More than 80% of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.

Thought:
- The question asks how the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been if Seydel planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips.
- Since the trials had no crops planted to avoid competition with emerging weeds, adding crops would introduce competition.

Criticism:
- The passage does not directly tell us what effect introducing crops have to the amount of weeds on the field surface.
- It may be speculated that introducing crops would lead to competition between the weeds and crops.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The passage states that Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips, one during the day and the other at night. The results showed more than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, while only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
- The question asks about the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two strips.
- The passage mentions that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.

Thought:
- The passage states that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. 
- This suggests that if crops were planted, there might be competition between the crops and the emerging weeds. 
- Competition between crops and weeds could potentially impact the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.

Criticism:
- We cannot definitively determine how planting wheat or corn would affect the percentage of the surface covered with weeds based on the information provided in the passage.
- However, we can infer that the presence of crops could introduce competition for resources (such as light, water, and nutrients) and may influence the success of the weeds.
- Thus, one possible outcome could be a lower percentage of the surface covered with weeds as crops compete for resources.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Recitation:
In the passage, it discusses the effect of plowing at different times of the day on weed growth in agricultural fields. The passage mentions an experiment by Hartmann, where two agricultural strips were plowed, one in daylight and one at night. The strips plowed in daylight had 80% of the surface covered by weeds, while the one plowed at night had only 2% covered by weeds. The pilot experiments did not plant any crops to avoid possible competition with emerging weeds.

Now, let's go through the options:

A: Lower than the percentage that Hartmann found - This scenario would occur if the presence of the crops somehow inhibits the growth of weeds.
B: Higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted - This would happen if the presence of crops promotes the growth of weeds.
C: Nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine - This would be the case if the presence of crops makes it too difficult to accurately measure weed growth.
D: Comparable to Hartmann's original projection - This option would be true if the presence of crops in the field does not significantly affect the weed growth observed in Hartmann's experiment.

Thought:
Option A and B consider the impact of crop planting on the percentage of weed coverage. However, there is no information in the passage discussing crop-weed interactions that would lead to an increase or decrease in weed growth. Option C assumes that having planted crops makes the measurement of weed growth nearly impossible, which does not seem plausible because researchers should still be able to examine and measure weed coverage even with crops present. Option D suggests that planting crops would not have any significant effects on the original observed percentages of weed coverage.

Criticism:
Given the information provided in the passage, it doesn't seem to provide any indication that planting crops would impact the experiment's outcomes significantly. Although the plausibility of option C could be debated, it's still likely that measurements could be taken with crops present. Option D seems the most supported and least speculative of the choices.

Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

  The passage describes a scene in which Father is speaking highly of inksticks and their qualities. It also mentions how Precious Auntie taught the narrator that good ink could not come easily and required effort. The quality, purpose, and meaning of ink are emphasized throughout the passage.

Analysis:
  A: Family relationships should be nurtured - This idea is present in the passage but not a main theme as the focus is more on the inksticks and their qualities.
  B: Quality is achieved through deliberate effort - This idea is strongly expressed through Precious Auntie's teachings and Father's description of high-quality inksticks.
  C: Hard work results in material compensation - Although the passage mentions the family's hard work and the results (displaying the inksticks), it's not a main theme.
  D: Creativity needs to be expressed concretely - This idea is not a main theme of the passage as it doesn't directly discuss the importance of concrete creativity.

Criticism:
  The passage's main theme seems to center around quality and effort. The idea of nurturing family relationships and hard work resulting in material compensation are present but not as prominent. The idea of creativity being expressed concretely is not a main theme at all.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage describes a visit to a family's ink shop where the narrator observes her father showcasing their high-quality inksticks and discussing their different qualities.
- Precious Auntie's teaching emphasizes that using an inkstick requires effort and thought, and it helps in cleansing one's mind and heart.

Thought:
- Option A focuses on family relationships, but the passage mainly highlights the appreciation for the quality and symbolism of the inksticks.
- Option B emphasizes the importance of deliberate effort, which is demonstrated by the teachings of Precious Auntie and echoed in the family's production of high-quality inksticks.
- Option C highlights material compensation, but the passage is more focused on the quality and meaning of their work.
- Option D discusses concrete expression of creativity, and while the passage does mention the creativity involved in making the inksticks, it is more focused on effort, meaning, and quality.

Criticism:
- The analysis of each option is accurate, and Option B appears to best represent the main theme of the passage.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 is written by Catharine Beecher and discusses women's roles in society and their influence on public life.

Analysis:
  In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women have a powerful influence within the home and family life, which in turn affects public life.

  A: This choice does not come directly from the passage. Beecher does not specifically say that men overlook women's thoughts about politics.
  B: This choice is present in the passage. Beecher states that women exert their influence within the home and family life, which in turn has an effect on public life.
  C: This choice is not found in the passage. Beecher does not state that women's influence on public life is unnecessary because men can govern society themselves.

Recap:
Passage 1 discusses the role and influence of women in society according to Beecher.

This would cause others to respect, esteem, and love women, leading them to willingly yield to their opinions and wishes.

A: Overlooked - The passage does not talk about women's effect on public life being overlooked, but rather about the ways they should influence it.

B: Indirect - The passage focuses on how women should influence others within their domestic and social circles, suggesting that their impact on public life would be more indirect.

C: Unnecessary - The passage does not imply that women's effect on public life is unnecessary; instead, it talks about how women should exert their influence.

D: Symbolic - The passage does not mention symbolism in women's role in public life. It emphasizes the importance of women's impact on society in a different manner than men.

It is clear that according to Beecher, women's influence on public life is not through direct involvement, but rather indirectly through influencing the men in their lives. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: indirect.

  A: Passage 1 is about the subordinate position of women and their appropriate role, whereas Passage 2 discusses the rights of slaves and moral nature. There doesn't seem to be a proposal made in Passage 1 that Passage 2 illustrates the practical difficulties of.
  B: Passage 1 argues that women should remain in their appropriate sphere and not participate in public debates or conflicts, while Passage 2 refutes the idea of higher rights based on sex and asserts that it is morally right for women to do what men do. The primary argument in Passage 1 is put into question in Passage 2.
  C: Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the perspective in Passage 1, but rather counters the argument made in Passage 1.
  D: Passage 2 does not elaborate upon ideas implied in Passage 1, it questions the notion that sex should determine a person's rights and responsibilities.

Criticism:
  Based on the thought process above, option B: "Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1" is the most accurate description of the relationship between the two passages.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Recap of passages:

Passage 1: States that women should maintain a subordinate position in society, focusing on their specific duties within the home. It argues that women should gather support and influence in domestic and social circles, and becoming involved in movements such as abolition goes against their appropriate role.

Passage 2: Claims that understanding the rights of slaves has led the author to a better understanding of her own rights. It asserts that all humans have the same moral rights regardless of sex, which contradicts the perspective offered in Passage 1.

Choice Analysis:

A: Passage 2 does not discuss practical difficulties, but rather moral principles and human rights.

B: Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1, stating that men and women have the same moral rights regardless of sex and, therefore, should not be confined to certain roles.

C: Passage 2 does not provide historical context, but rather challenges the primary argument of Passage 1 based on moral rights and equality.

D: Passage 2 does not elaborate on ideas implied in Passage 1 but rather challenges the main argument of Passage 1.

Conclusion: Based on the content in both passages, choice B is the best answer as Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that the main reason that the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received is because

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The data in table 2 best support which statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey?
Choices:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  We are given a context about a study on woodpecker finches and their use of tools to acquire prey. We have to answer a question based on table 2 (which is not actually provided), but we can infer information from the context and answer choices.

Thought:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
      - We are not provided with information about how many attempts were made before success.
      
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
      - In the context, it is mentioned that "after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method". This contradicts choice B.

  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
      - In the context, it is mentioned that the five birds significantly increased their use of the method after initial success. But it doesn't specify the number of attempts made. 

  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
      - While we do not have specific information on how many attempts were made, it is mentioned that "at some point during the study, each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice." This indicates that the technique was likely not successful on the first attempt for any of the birds. 

Criticism:
  Although we do not have a clear indication of how many attempts were made for each bird before success, choice D seems more plausible based on the information given in the context. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
The question asks us to make a statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey, based on data in table 2, which is not provided in the text. Since it is impossible to answer this question with only the information provided in the text, I will address it based on the information given in the text.

From the text: "After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method." This indicates that the birds did not stop using the technique after the first success, but rather increased their use.

Choices:
  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
     - Nothing in the text suggests a specific number of attempts made before success.
  B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
     - This is contradicted by the text, where it says that they increased their use of this method after initial success.
  C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
     - Nothing in the text suggests a specific number of attempts after the first success.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
     - The text does not provide information about the number of attempts before the first success.

Although the question specifically asks for information from table 2, which is not provided, the text does provide some information about the levering technique. Based on the text, we can say that choice B is the least likely choice, as it is directly contradicted by the text, while the other choices cannot be determined with the given information.
However, as I must choose from the given options, I chose:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
There is no specific information provided in the text about Table 2 to analyze the given choices. As an AI language model, I am unable to access the table values to make a proper selection based on the information from the table alone.

However, we can analyze the available text to see if any of the choices make sense with the provided information.

A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
- The text doesn't mention the number of attempts before acquiring prey.

B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
- The text says, "After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.." which contradicts this statement.

C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
- The text doesn't mention the number of attempts after their first success; however, it does say that their use of the method increased after initial success.

D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
- The text doesn't provide any information about their success rate in their first attempts.

Based on the information provided in the text, the only statement that appears to be directly contradicted by the information is choice B.

However, it is important to note that the answer should come solely from the data presented in Table 2. As the table is not provided, the answer is ultimately inconclusive based on the given text.
Response 3:
I cannot see Table 2. However, I can analyze the text given and try to answer the question based on the information provided.

Information from the text:

1. Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
2. At some point during the study, each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
3. After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.

Based on the information above, let's analyze the choices:

A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
- The text does not provide any information to support this statement.

B: After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether.
- The text refutes this statement. It states that after the initial success, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.

C: After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times.
- The text does not provide any information to support this statement. It only states that the five birds significantly increased their use of this method after the initial success.

D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.
- The text does not provide any information to directly support this statement. However, considering the available information, this statement seems the most plausible. It is mentioned that at some point during the study, they dropped their tool into the artificial crevice, which implies that they might have tried other techniques before.

Critically evaluating the information and choices, the best choice appears to be:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Since the given passage does not include table 2, it is not possible to answer this question accurately. The passage does mention the levering technique, but it does not provide enough information to make a conclusion based on the given choices (A, B, C, or D). Please provide table 2 or another passage that has information related to the data in table 2.
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that five individual woodpeckers developed a unique tool-using technique involving dropping the tool into the artificial crevice and levering the prey out. After initial success, they significantly increased their use of this method.

Thought:
  Information from table 2 is not provided in the passage but needed to analyze the answer choices.
  However, we can logically eliminate some answer choices based on the context given in the passage.

Criticism:
  B: The passage does not indicate that any of the birds ceased using the technique altogether after their first success. This answer choice is likely incorrect.
  C: The passage describes that the use of the technique increased after initial success, not that they stopped using the technique after the first success. This answer choice is likely incorrect.

  Based on the passage, we can infer that the woodpecker finches experienced some level of trial and error with the unique levering technique. The remaining answer choices are:

  A: At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey.
  D: None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique.

Both A and D options seem plausible based on given information from the passage, but since we are asked to choose the answer that best fits the data in table 2, which we don't have, it is impossible to confidently select an answer.

In cases like this, where available information is insufficient, it is ideal to have access to the table or relevant data. However, since we are required to answer based on given choices, we will make the best possible guess.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
There is no table 2 provided. However, based on the given context, we can analyze the situation and choose the best answer.

Statements from context:
1. "Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild."
2. "At some point during the study, each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice."
3. "After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method."

Thought:
A: The context doesn't mention the number of attempts it took for any of the birds to succeed.
B: This seems unlikely, as it goes against statement 3, which says the usage of this technique increased.
C: The context again doesn't mention the number of attempts made after the initial success.
D: The context doesn't give a clear indication of whether they were successful in their first attempt or not, but it's the only option that doesn't contradict any information in the text.

Criticism:
Since the context doesn't provide all the needed information to choose the correct answer reliably, we have to evaluate the information we do have. The only piece of evidence that matches the information in the context is option D, which states that none of them were successful in their first attempt. This is because we only know that they eventually succeeded and increased the use of the method.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
There is no table 2 shown in the provided text, so it is impossible to base the answer on the table. However, from the information provided in the paragraphs, we can try to make a logical guess.

Knowledge:
- We know that five woodpecker finches developed a unique levering technique.
- They dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach.

Thoughts:
The text states that after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method. We can conclude that they kept using the technique after they were successful with it.

Criticism:
While information about the number of attempts, first success, and continued usage of the technique are not explicitly given, we can use available information to make a reasoned guess.

Action: Answer("A")
This choice seems most plausible based on the text since it supports the idea that after initial success, these woodpecker finches continued to use the technique to get their prey. Additionally, the other options either contradict or aren't supported by the text.
Response 8:
In this passage, the author describes experimental studies regarding tool use in woodpecker finches. The primary emphasis is on a specific study that focused on the potential social learning aspect of tool use in these birds. The study found that woodpecker finches did not rely on social learning from a model to develop their tool-use abilities. Instead, the development of tool use seemed to be based on genetically fixed components. The passage also states that woodpecker finches that had never had the opportunity to observe tool-using adults developed the same level aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps in their tool-oriented behavior alongside their siblings who had observed adult tool use.

Although the passage did not refer to table 2 or the specific choices provided, a statement about the woodpecker finches that used the unique levering technique to acquire prey can still be inferred. 

Choices:
  A: "At least one of them attempted the technique five times before successfully acquiring prey."
  There is no concrete evidence in the passage that supports or contradicts this choice. However, it is worth noting that the passage mentions the birds had initial success with the technique and increased its use.

  B: "After the first success at acquiring prey, a few of them ceased using the technique altogether."
  This statement can be refuted by the passage, which states that after initial success, the birds significantly increased their use of the method.

  C: "After the first success at acquiring the prey, none of them attempted the technique more than five times."
  This specific choice contradicts the passage's mention of the birds significantly increasing their use of the method after initial success.

  D: "None of them were successful in their first attempt with the technique."
  The passage does not discuss the overall success of the woodpecker finches in their initial attempt at the technique. However, it does mention that "after initial success," the birds significantly increased their use of the method. While this doesn't directly support choice D, it can be inferred that they might not have been successful in their first attempt since "initial success" implies it took some time and effort to get to that point.

Based on the information available from the passage, the best answer to select is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
The passage provided does not include table 2. However, the passage discusses a levering technique that was used by some woodpecker finches to acquire prey in an artificial environment. To answer the question, we need to rely on information in the text rather than a missing table. 

Relevant information from the text:
"At some point during the study, each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice. After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method."

From this excerpt, we can derive the following information:
1. The birds did not use the levering technique in their first attempt, but they learned it during the course of the study.
2. After having initial success with the levering technique, the birds increased their use of the method.

No information is provided about the number of attempts before a successful prey acquisition. Thus we do not have enough information to evaluate choices A and C. Based on the excerpt, choice B is incorrect as the birds significantly increased the use of the levering technique after their initial success. 

Based on the information provided, the best answer seems to be:

Action: Answer("D")

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.
Question: The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to
Choices:
  A: suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.
  B: establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor.
  C: introduce Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher.
  D: demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions.
Response 0:
Recitation: 
  The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord occurs in the text when Ralphord asked what she studied at Barnyard College (Barnard College). Miss Spivey explained that Barnard was the sister school of Columbia University and clarified the college's name.

A: Suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge - The interaction does show that Miss Spivey potentially overestimated the children's knowledge about colleges and universities, but it is not the main purpose of the interaction.

B: Establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor - There is somewhat of a friendly dynamic between Miss Spivey and the students from the mentioned interaction. Still, it is not explicitly shown that Miss Spivey is indulgent or doting with them.

C: Introduce Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher - Ralphord seems curious, asking questions to the teacher. However, Miss Spivey does not come across as dismissive or disinterested in the interaction, as she explains the college's name and its sister school.

D: Demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions - The interaction shows Ralphord asking a question, but it does not necessarily show that they want to amuse Miss Spivey. 

Thought:
  The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord occurs when Ralphord asked about her studies at Barnyard College, and she explained the college's name and its connection to Columbia University. This interaction displays a friendly dynamic, but the main purpose seems to be highlighting Miss Spivey's expectation of what information should be considered common knowledge.

Criticism:
  Reflecting on the options presented, option A seems accurate due to the interaction shows that Miss Spivey overestimated what the children might already know about Barnard College.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Miss Spivey is the new schoolteacher in Threestep, Georgia.
- She shares her background and worldly experiences with her new students.
- Ralphord, a student, asks about her studies at "Barnyard College", which is actually Barnard College.
- Miss Spivey explains that Barnard is the sister school of Columbia University and writes it on the blackboard.

Thoughts:
- The interaction between Ralphord and Miss Spivey revolves around Ralphord's question about her studies at "Barnyard College".
- The interaction helps to establish Miss Spivey's background, correcting the name of the college, and her connection to prominent academic institutions.

Criticism:
- The interaction does not suggest any exaggerated view on common knowledge from Miss Spivey.
- The interaction does not demonstrate a friendly, doting dynamic or introduce Ralphord as precocious and Miss Spivey as disinterested.
- The interaction does not suggest the children's main intention is to amuse Miss Spivey.

Conclusion:
The context of the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to correct the name of the college she attended and establish her connection to a prominent academic institution. The passage does not fit the description of any of the given choices.

However, since it is required to select one of the available choices, evaluating the passage again:
- The interaction might be viewed as suggesting that Miss Spivey assumes the students have heard of Columbia University, which can be seen as an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.

C: Introduce Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher.
D: Demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions.

Thought:
- Ralphord asks about "Barnyard College", but Miss Spivey corrects him and explains that it is Barnard College.
- Miss Spivey also clarifies that Barnard is a sister school of Columbia University.
- She doesn't appear to be annoyed or dismissive and is providing information.
- The interaction highlights Miss Spivey's knowledge and her willingness to share it with the students.

Criticism:
- A: Miss Spivey does not appear to have an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge. However, she does assume that the students would have heard of Columbia University.
- B: While the interaction might not show an indulgent and doting dynamic, it does show a friendly and informative interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord.
- C: This choice seems incorrect, as Miss Spivey does not come across as dismissive or disinterested and Ralphord doesn't come off as a precocious young student.
- D: This choice is also not supported by the text, as there is no indication that the children are trying to amuse Miss Spivey through their questions.

Conclusion: The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to establish a friendly dynamic between the students and their informative new instructor. Thus, the best answer seems to be B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- Miss Spivey is the new schoolteacher in Threestep, Georgia, in 1938.
- Miss Spivey tells the students about her education, including attending Barnard College.
- Ralphord, the narrator's little brother, asks what she studied at "Barnyard College."
- Miss Spivey corrects him, writing "Barnard" on the blackboard, and explains that it's affiliated with Columbia University.

Thought: 
- Option A: There is no evidence in the text that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of common knowledge. She simply corrects Ralphord's mistake with Barnard College and explains its affiliation.
- Option B: The interaction shows Miss Spivey correcting Ralphord's mistake and providing information about Barnard College. It doesn't necessarily establish a friendly dynamic, but it also doesn't show her dismissing or disinterested in the students.
- Option C: Miss Spivey doesn't appear to be dismissive or disinterested in the text. Ralphord may not be portrayed as precocious, as he mispronounces Barnard College, but this option doesn't quite fit either. 
- Option D: The interaction doesn't demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions. Ralphord's question appears to be sincere, and Miss Spivey answers it in a straightforward manner.

Criticism:
- Although Option A may not be a perfect answer, it would be the closest choice to the situation described in the text. Miss Spivey's correction of Ralphord could be seen as her assuming they should know about the prestigious Barnard College. The other options are not accurate representations of the interaction.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
In the text, Miss Spivey is the new schoolteacher who has an extensive background in education and world travels. Ralphord is a student in her class.
A: Suggesting Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge might refer to her expectation that the students know about certain things like Barnard College or Columbia University.
B: Establishing a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor could refer to the interactions between Miss Spivey and her students, including Ralphord.
C: Introducing Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher might refer to their interaction, including Ralphord's question about Barnard College.
D: Demonstrating that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions could refer to the way students ask questions directed to Miss Spivey.

Thought:
When Ralphord asks about Barnyard College, Miss Spivey corrects him and tells the students about Columbia University and Barnard College. She does not dismiss or show disinterest; she educates her students. The interaction does not seem to be about the children amusing Miss Spivey with their questions. The dynamic between Miss Spivey and the students seems friendly, but the interaction between her and Ralphord mainly highlights her expectations of what should be considered common knowledge.

Criticism:
The text demonstrates the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord, showing that she provided information about Barnard College and expected her students to know about Columbia University, which may not be common knowledge in their rural setting. The text does not imply Ralphord is precocious, nor does it suggest that Miss Spivey is disinterested or dismissive. The text also does not present the children as attempting to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  - The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord is when Ralphord asks about her studies at "Barnyard College," and Miss Spivey corrects him by explaining it's Barnard College.
  - A: An exaggerated view of common knowledge would mean Miss Spivey assumes her students know more than they actually do.
  - B: A friendly dynamic would suggest a positive and good-natured relationship between Miss Spivey and the students.
  - C: Introducing Ralphord as precocious would mean he's advanced for his age, and Miss Spivey as dismissive and disinterested would mean she doesn't really care about her students.
  - D: Demonstrating the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with questions would show that their main purpose in interacting with her is to entertain her.

Thought:
  - Ralphord asks Miss Spivey what she studied at "Barnyard College".
  - Miss Spivey explains that Barnard College is the sister school of Columbia University and expects the students to have heard of it.
  - This could suggest that Miss Spivey assumes her students know more than they actually do, as reflected in option A.

Criticism:
  - The interaction doesn't establish a friendly dynamic between schoolchildren and their teacher, as it focuses on their ignorance rather than a warm relationship. Option B is not accurate.
  - There isn't enough information in the text to show that Ralphord is precocious or that Miss Spivey is dismissive and disinterested so we can disregard option C.
  - There is no evidence to suggest that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions. So option D is not accurate.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought Process:
- Miss Spivey has just introduced herself as someone who has traveled extensively and had attended Barnard College in New York City.
- Ralphord asked a question about what she studied at "Barnyard College," which was a playful mispronunciation of "Barnard."
- Miss Spivey explained that Barnard was the sister school of Columbia University, and she expected they all had heard of it.
- Miss Spivey avoids Ralphord's eye when she paused for questions, which may imply she is not fully indulgent of his playful question.

Choice analysis:
A: Suggests that Miss Spivey thinks her experience should be common knowledge – possible but not clearly demonstrated by the interaction.
B: Establishing a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor – could be true, but the interaction doesn't necessarily imply full indulgence from Miss Spivey.
C: Introducing Ralphord as a precocious young student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher – seems too extreme. Miss Spivey did not seem dismissive, but there is a hint of her not being fully indulgent of Ralphord's question.
D: Demonstrates that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions – not really demonstrated by the interaction, as Ralphord was mainly the one trying to amuse her.

Conclusion: 
Based on the analysis, the most fitting answer is A since it shows that Miss Spivey expected that most of the students had heard of the institutions she's attended, even if they were from a small town.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Recap:

Miss Spivey is a new school teacher in Threestep, Georgia. She has an extensive background in travel and education and shares her experiences with her students on the first day of school. Ralphord, a student in her class, asks her about "Barnyard College," which Miss Spivey corrects as Barnard College and explains that it is the sister school of Columbia University. 

Analysis:

A: This choice suggests that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge. However, her response to Ralphord's question is informative and not exaggerated.

B: This choice talks about the establishment of a friendly dynamic between the students and their teacher. Miss Spivey's interaction with Ralphord does show her willingness to provide clarification, but it doesn't necessarily establish a strong friendly dynamic by itself.

C: This choice describes Ralphord as a precocious student and Miss Spivey as a dismissive and disinterested teacher. Ralphord's question may show curiosity, but it doesn't paint him as particularly precocious, and Miss Spivey's response doesn't come across as dismissive or disinterested.

D: This choice reflects the idea that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions. Ralphord's question might seem amusing, but it does not appear that the purpose of the interaction was specifically to amuse Miss Spivey.

Based on the analysis, the most fitting answer is A since it highlights the notion that Miss Spivey may think her students should know about something like Barnard College.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  In the passage, Miss Spivey is a new schoolteacher who has arrived in Threestep, Georgia.
  Ralphord is a student who asks a question about the name of the college.
  Ralphord's question is related to the pronunciation of the letters as Barnyard College when it is actually Barnard College.

Thought:
  A: The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord might suggest that she assumes her students are more knowledgeable about certain institutions than they actually are.
  B: The interaction establishes that Miss Spivey is patient in addressing the questions of the students; however, it doesn't necessarily establish a friendly dynamic or that she is doting on the children.
  C: Ralphord's question introduces him as a curious student, but it doesn't suggest that Miss Spivey is dismissive or disinterested since she takes the time to answer the question.
  D: The question doesn't necessarily demonstrate that the children want to amuse Miss Spivey since Ralphord's question could simply be due to genuine curiosity and confusion.

Criticism:
  A: The interaction suggests that Miss Spivey may have overestimated her students' knowledge but doesn't entirely focus on that.
  B: The interaction isn't explicitly focused on establishing a friendly dynamic between the charming children and doting instructor.
  C: This choice could be misleading as Miss Spivey is not dismissive or disinterested in her response.
  D: It doesn't appear that the children aim to amuse Miss Spivey with their questions, making this choice less accurate.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: Information in Passage 2 best supports which conclusion about the mice in the experiment described in Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: Exposure to teixobactin made them less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections.
  B: Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.
  C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
  D: Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.

    - Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice.
    - It doesn't kill gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall.

Thought process:
  A: Passage 1 and 2 mention that teixobactin is effective against bacteria causing upper respiratory tract infections but do not mention if it makes the mice less susceptible to subsequent infections.
  B: The passages do not mention that gram-positive bacteria enhance the effectiveness of teixobactin against upper respiratory tract infections.
  C: Since teixobactin is effective against gram-positive bacteria and doesn't kill gram-negative opportunists, and it was effective in treating the mice's upper respiratory tract infections, it is likely that their infections were not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
  D: Passages mention that teixobactin attacks the lipid molecules of bacterial cell walls, not proteins.

Criticism:
  The thought process is accurate in evaluating the information in both passages and relating them to the given answer choices.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  - Passage 1 states that teixobactin was effective against upper respiratory tract infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, both gram-positive bacteria.
  - Additionally, passage 1 explains that teixobactin attacks the lipid molecules in bacterial cell walls, not the proteins.
  - Passage 2 mentions teixobactin was unable to kill gram-negative bacteria due to its size and the complexity of their cell walls.

Answer analysis:
  A: The passages do not mention anything about mice being less susceptible to subsequent upper respiratory tract infections. 
  B: While gram-positive bacteria are mentioned in both passages, there is no information to suggest that these bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin.
  C: Given that teixobactin was effective against the mice's infections and it is mentioned in passage 2 that teixobactin does not kill gram-negative bacteria, we can conclude that their infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
  D: This statement is false, as passage 1 mentions that teixobactin attacks the lipid molecules in bacterial cell walls, not the proteins.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Relevant information from Passage 1:
- Teixobactin was effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria, even those resistant to other drugs.
- Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin.
- The drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
- Teixobactin breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically.

Relevant information from Passage 2:
- Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory.
- It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
- Teixobactin doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall.

Now, let's evaluate each answer choice:

- The passages do not provide information about subsequent infections. It only states that teixobactin effectively treated the existing infections.

B: Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin against their upper respiratory tract infections.
- The passages do not mention that Gram-positive bacteria enhanced the effectiveness of teixobactin. It only states that teixobactin was effective against Gram-positive bacteria.

C: Their upper respiratory tract infections were likely not caused by gram-negative bacteria.
- Teixobactin was effective at treating the mice's upper respiratory tract infections, and it is mentioned that teixobactin doesn't kill Gram-negative bacteria. This indicates that the infections these mice had were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.

D: Teixobactin attacked the proteins of the bacteria that caused their upper respiratory tract infections.
- The passages state that teixobactin breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules, not the proteins.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Recited Knowledge:
- Passage 1 states that mice infected with bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
- Teixobactin is effective because it breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically.
- From Passage 2, we learn that teixobactin kills Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice.
- It also states that teixobactin doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall.

Thought:
- Option A is not supported by either passage, as it doesn't mention if the mice became less susceptible to subsequent infections after exposure to teixobactin.
- Option B is not supported by the passages either, as they don't mention the role of Gram-positive bacteria in enhancing teixobactin's effectiveness against their upper respiratory tract infections.
- Option C is likely accurate, as teixobactin is effective against Gram-positive bacteria and doesn't work against Gram-negative bacteria. The mice's infections were cleared by teixobactin treatment, hence their infections were likely not caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
- Option D is not supported, as teixobactin targets the lipid molecules in bacterial cell walls, not the proteins of the bacteria.

Criticism:
- My reasoning seems logical, with no errors or bias.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: According to the passage, which statement best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close?
Choices:
  A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
  B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a specific concentration of calcium ions in order to close its trap. The touching of one trigger hair starts an increase in calcium ions, but it is not enough to close the trap. A second trigger hair needs to be touched to add to the calcium ion concentration to meet the threshold for the trap to close. The calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, so if the second trigger doesn't occur within a short amount of time, the final concentration won't be enough to close the trap.

Thought:
  The passage does not mention that the second trigger reverses the charge or stabilizes the surge of calcium ions. The second trigger prompt is what causes the calcium channels to open, but the main reason is to supplement the calcium concentration to reach the required threshold. 

Criticism:
  My understanding and summary of the passage are consistent with the information provided. The best answer should involve the second trigger supplementing the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Relevant knowledge:
According to the passage:
- Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential and the opening of calcium channels, leading to an increase in calcium ion concentration (lines 40-45).
- A high concentration of calcium is required for the trap to close, but a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level (lines 50-55).
- A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap (lines 55-60).
- The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold (lines 60-65).

Choices analysis:
A: There is no mention in the passage about the second trigger reversing the charge produced by the first trigger.
B: The second trigger does not stabilize the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger. It helps push the concentration over the threshold.
C: The first trigger hair, not the second, prompts the calcium channels to open initially.
D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger, which helps push the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.

Thought process:
- Since touching one trigger hair does not cause enough calcium ion concentration to close the trap, touching a second trigger hair within a short amount of time is necessary to supplement the calcium concentration to push it over the threshold.
- Therefore, choice D best explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time for the trap to close.

Criticism:
- The conclusion follows logically from the information provided in the passage and the analysis of the choices.
- There are no flaws in the facts, logic, or reasoning.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
 - The passage explains that the Venus flytrap only closes its trap when it's sure that the insect on its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
 - The triggering mechanism is the touch of its hairs.
 - The second touch of a hair within 20 seconds is needed to trigger the trap to close.
 - According to Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers, the flytrap stores information about how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
 - Touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential and induces calcium channels to open, increasing the concentration of calcium ions.
 - The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
 - A single action potential from one hair is not enough to reach the required calcium concentration. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold.
 
Thought:
 - The question asks why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
 - The passage mentions that the calcium ion concentrations will dissipate over time, and a second touch is needed to push the calcium concentration over the threshold for closing the trap.

Criticism:
 - The provided information is accurate and can be used to evaluate the answer choices.

Action: Answer("D")
 - The correct answer is D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger. This is because the second trigger helps to push the calcium concentration over the threshold needed for the trap to close.
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that the Venus flytrap requires a second hair to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.

Thought:
  The second trigger hair being touched within a short amount of time ensures that the calcium concentration released by the first trigger will be supplemented, reaching the necessary threshold for the trap to close. This is mentioned in lines 55-60.

Criticism:
  My understanding of the passage and the step-by-step evaluation process seems to be sound. Based on the passage, the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger, reaching the threshold needed for the trap to close.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The second hair touch causes the calcium concentration to increase again.
- The trap requires a high concentration of calcium in order to close.
- A single action potential from one trigger hair being touched does not reach the required calcium concentration level.
- Calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time.

Thought:
- According to the passage, the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time because the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
- The second trigger helps push the calcium concentration over the threshold required for the trap to close.
- If the second touch doesn't occur quickly enough, the calcium ion concentration will dissipate and the trap won't close.

Criticism:
- The thought process is accurate and based on information provided in the passage.
- The answer choice that best aligns with this thought process is D, which states that the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
- Venus flytrap closes trap when it is sure that the insect is large enough. 
- Trap closes when two hairs are touched within 20 seconds.
- 2nd hair touch encodes and stores the information. 
- Electric charge of its leaf stores the information regarding how many hairs have been touched.
- Touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential and induces calcium channels to open.
- Trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
- A single action potential does not reach the required calcium concentration.
- Second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold.
 
Thought:
- The passage explains that the Venus flytrap needs a second trigger within a short time so that calcium concentration can increase enough to close the trap.
- The second trigger helps push the calcium concentration over the required threshold.
- Answer D focuses on the second trigger providing a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger. 

Criticism:
- The thought process aligns with the information provided in the passage.
- Statements A, B, and C do not align with the explanation provided in the passage about the role second trigger hair plays in closing the trap.
- Answer D correctly captures the role of the second trigger hair based on the information in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Relevant knowledge: 
- From the passage (lines 55-60), it's mentioned that a second trigger hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold needed to close the trap.
- The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.

Thought:
- The passage explains that the trap closing requires a certain concentration of calcium. It says that a single action potential from one trigger hair does not reach this level. This implies that the second trigger hair being touched provides a necessary supplement of calcium concentration to reach the required level for the trap closing.

Criticism:
- The passage clearly states that the second trigger hair contributes the necessary calcium concentration for the trap to close, which is in line with option D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The passage explains that the Venus flytrap has a system to decide when it's worth closing its trap.
It states that an insect needs to touch two hairs within 20 seconds for the trap to close.
Hodick and Sievers proposed that the number of hairs touched is stored in the electric charge on the leaf, and that touching a hair causes an electric action potential that opens calcium channels, increasing calcium ion concentration.
Their proposal suggests that a second hair needs to be triggered to push the calcium concentration to a threshold for the trap to close.
If the second hair isn't triggered within the 20 seconds, the calcium ion concentrations dissipate, preventing the trap from closing.

Thought:
A: The passage does not indicate that the second trigger hair reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
B: The passage does not say that the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
C: The passage mentions that an electric action potential opens calcium channels but doesn't specifically link it to the second trigger prompting the calcium channels to open.
D: According to the text, the second trigger hair provides a necessary added calcium concentration to reach the threshold for the trap to close.

Criticism:
Option D is consistent with the information in the passage, which suggests that with the second trigger, the calcium concentration increases, and when it crosses the threshold level, the trap closes.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The passage describes how the Venus flytrap uses its hairs to sense prey and how touching a second hair within a short timeframe causes the trap to close.
- The passage explains that touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential and the opening of calcium channels, resulting in a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.
- A second hair must be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over a certain threshold and spring the trap shut.
- If the second touch doesn't happen quickly enough, the calcium ion concentrations will dissipate, and the trap won't close.

Thought:
- The question asks us to determine the best explanation for why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time.
- Based on the knowledge gathered from the passage, the explanation lies in the calcium ion concentration needed to close the trap.

Criticism:
- Let's evaluate the given options:
  A: The passage doesn't mention anything about a reversal of charge produced by the first trigger, so this option is incorrect.
  B: The passage doesn't discuss any surge of calcium ions or stabilization related to the first trigger, so this option is incorrect as well.
  C: The passage states that the first trigger hair's touch causes the calcium channels to open. Option C is incorrect since it does not best describe the reason for the short time in which the second trigger must be touched.
  D: The second trigger's touch is necessary to supplement the calcium concentration released by the first trigger so that it exceeds the threshold required to close the trap. Option D aligns with the passage's information and answers the question correctly.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains the process of the Venus flytrap closing its trap.
  The large black hairs on the leaves act as triggers for the closing mechanism.
  A single action potential from one hair being touched does not reach the required calcium concentration level to close the trap.
  A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and close the trap.

Thought:
  A: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention the second trigger producing an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger.
  B: Stabilizing the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger is not the reason given for the necessity of the second trigger hair being touched, as the passage states it is for increasing the calcium concentration.
  C: The passage mentions the opening of calcium channels when the trigger hairs are touched. However, this takes place upon the touch of individual trigger hairs and is not explicitly linked to the second trigger hair being touched.
  D: The passage states that a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold to close the trap. This suggests that the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

Criticism:
  The passage does not provide any information supporting choices A, B, and C. The information provided for choice D aligns with what is explained in the passage regarding the necessity of the second trigger hair being touched for the trap to close.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: Based on the passage, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected which condition to result from the blocking of fast fibers?
Choices:
  A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase.
  B: The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful.
  C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
  D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.
Response 0:
Relevant knowledge:
- Textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature.
- Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location.
- Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.

Thought:
  If textbooks in the early 1990s believed that fast-signaling nerve fibers were responsible for the sensation of pressure and vibration, then blocking these fibers would likely impact the test subject's ability to perceive those sensations.

Criticism:
The passage supports this analysis, as it states that blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that in the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature.
  It also states that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location.

Thoughts:
  To determine the expected condition resulting from the blocking of fast fibers, we need to understand how textbooks in the early 1990s believed these fibers functioned.
  Based on the passage, fast fibers were thought to be responsible for transmitting sensations of pressure and vibration.

Options Analysis:
  A: The rate at which other nerve fibers fired would increase - This option doesn't align with the information provided in the passage. There is no mention of the rate of other nerve fibers increasing.
  B: The test subject would perceive gentle stimuli as painful - According to the passage, pain travels along slow fibers, not fast fibers. So blocking fast fibers wouldn't change how gentle stimuli are perceived as painful.
  C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure - This option contradicts the early 1990s understanding stated in the passage, where slow fibers were believed to only respond to pain and temperature, not pressure.
  D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired - This answer aligns with what we know about fast fibers. Since fast fibers were believed to transmit sensations of pressure and vibration, blocking them would likely result in an impaired ability to perceive vibrations.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Relevant Knowledge:
- In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves that responded to pain and temperature but not pressure or vibration.
- Back then, sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.
- Experiments blocking nerve fibers showed preventing fast fibers from transmitting signals seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.

Thought Process:
- If fast fibers, which transmit pressure and vibration, were blocked, the ability to sense pressure and vibration would be impaired.
- Therefore, textbook authors in the early 1990s would most likely have expected blocking fast fibers to impair the ability to perceive vibrations.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Relevant knowledge:
- Textbooks in the early 1990s asserted that slow-conducting nerves only responded to pain and temperature stimuli.
- Sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers.
- Experiments blocking nerve fibers showed: Preventing fast fibers from firing eliminated the sensation of pressure altogether.

Thought:
- The question asks what would be expected if blocking fast fibers, based on early 1990s textbooks.
- As the textbooks assert pressure and vibration sensations travel on fast fibers, blocking them would eliminate pressure sensation.
- Therefore, the most likely outcome would be an impairment in the ability to perceive vibrations as well.

Criticism:
- None, the facts and logic align correctly.

Action: Answer("D")

- Preventing fast fibers from firing seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.

Thought Process:
- The question asks what textbook authors in the early 1990s would have expected from the blocking of fast fibers.
- Since the passage states that blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, the expected result would involve a loss of pressure sensation.
- A: The rate of other nerve fibers firing is not mentioned in the passage.
- B: The passage does not suggest that gentle stimuli would be perceived as painful.
- C: The passage does not mention that the body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.
- D: The ability to perceive vibration would be impaired, as vibration travels along fast fibers, which is consistent with the passage.

Criticism:
- The facts and logic are correct, as the question's answer is based on the early 1990s understanding of fast and slow fibers, as mentioned in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")

Thought: 
  The question asks what would have been expected by early 1990s textbook authors when fast fibers are blocked.
  According to the passage, blocking fast fibers seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether.
  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired since it is also mentioned to travel only along fast-signaling nerve fibers.
  
  The answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.

Blocking these fast fibers would impair the ability to perceive those sensations. Thus, the textbooks would have expected the blocking of fast fibers to lead to the impairment of vibrations and pressure sensing.

  Based on this information, I can conclude that the answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.

  If fast fibers are blocked, since they are responsible for sensing pressure and vibration, it should impair the ability to perceive those sensations.
  Therefore, the early 1990s textbook authors would most likely expect blocking of fast fibers to result in impairment of perceiving vibrations.
  The answer is D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect

Choices:
  A: primitive.
  B: basaltic.
  C: high in reflectivity.
  D: low in reflectivity.
Response 0:
Thought process:
- The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and the reasons why iron meteorites are more common than rocky mantle fragments.
- Differentiated asteroids have a combination of iron and rocky mantles, while primitive asteroids are mostly made of chondritic materials and are undifferentiated.
- The survivability of iron fragments when the asteroid bodies break apart is higher than that of rocky fragments, because they are stronger and more resistant to disruption.
- The passage suggests that perhaps most differentiated bodies broke apart early in the solar system and the mantle materials have been ground down to dust and lost over the years.
- The passage mentions that primitive asteroids make up the majority of meteorites found on Earth.
- The question asks about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole.

Answer: A: primitive.

The passage contains more information to support the conclusion that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole is in asteroids that are primitive. This is because primitive bodies have had a better survival rate compared to the differentiated bodies.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Primitive asteroids: Parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  Basaltic: Rocks formed from the cooling of lava at the surface. Not mentioned in the passage.
  High reflectivity: No direct relation between asteroid mass and reflectivity mentioned in the passage.
  Low reflectivity: No direct relation between asteroid mass and reflectivity mentioned in the passage.

Thought:
  The passage talks about the rarity of mantle rocks and differentiated bodies compared to primitive asteroids. The passage says, "Most of these objects [primitive meteorites] survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron." Therefore, the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole is likely in asteroids that are primitive.

Criticism:
  The thought process accurately took information from the passage to determine that the majority of mass in the asteroid belt is in primitive asteroids. No flaws detected in the facts, logic, or reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Primitive asteroids: the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  - Basaltic: related to basalt, which is a type of igneous rock formed from cooled lava.
  - Reflectivity: the ability to reflect light.
  - The text mentions that today's asteroid belt is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.

Thought:
  Let's see which of the options aligns with the information provided in the text:
  A: Primitive asteroids are mentioned in the text as being the majority in the asteroid belt.
  B: Basaltic characteristics are not mentioned in the text as being related to the majority of asteroids.
  C: High reflectivity is not mentioned in the text as being related to the majority of asteroids.
  D: Low reflectivity is not mentioned in the text as being related to the majority of asteroids.

Conclusion:
  Based on the information in the text, the best answer is A: primitive, as the asteroid belt is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron, with primitive asteroids being the majority.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought process:

- The passage mostly discusses the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection, the missing mantle problem, and the survival of iron fragments better than rocky fragments.
- Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are mentioned as more abundant than differentiated asteroids (those composed of mantle rocks).
- Primitive asteroids are more common than differentiated ones, so they are more likely to contribute to a larger portion of the mass of the asteroid belt.

Based on the thought process, the answer seems to be closest to option A: primitive.

Criticism:

- The thought process seems logical and it does follow the information from the passage.
- The other options are not supported by the text.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Primitive asteroids: These are undifferentiated and the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
  Basaltic asteroids: These could be associated with the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids; however, the text states that mantle rocks are very rare in the asteroid belt, which implies that basaltic asteroids are not the majority.
  Reflectivity: The passage does not specifically provide data about the reflectivity of asteroids in relation to their mass or composition.

Thought:
  The passage states that intact differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today, and later mentions that primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt and most of them survived. This suggests that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole may be in primitive asteroids.

Criticism:
  The thought process is correct, taking into account that most of the intact differentiated asteroids are rare, suggesting that primitive asteroids make up the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt. The passage doesn't provide data to link asteroid mass to reflectivity, which eliminates choices C and D.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states that primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorites found on Earth. This indicates that primitive asteroids are more numerous in comparison to differentiated asteroids. Furthermore, if most differentiated bodies broke apart early in the solar system, then intact differentiated asteroids are rare in the asteroid belt today. 

  A: Primitive - According to the passage, primitive asteroids are more common than differentiated asteroids, indicating a higher mass in the asteroid belt.

  B: Basaltic - The passage does not provide information about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt being basaltic.

  C: High in reflectivity - The passage does not provide information about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt being high in reflectivity.

  D: Low in reflectivity - The passage does not provide information about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt being low in reflectivity.

Criticism: 
  The information in the passage supports the notion that primitive asteroids are more numerous than differentiated asteroids, in turn, indicating a higher mass in the asteroid belt.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The text discusses differentiated and primitive asteroids and their survivability. It explains that differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today, and perhaps Vesta and a few others are all that remain. Primitive asteroids, which are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are more abundant.

Based on this information from the text, the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt consists of asteroids that are primitive.

Criticism:
I have considered the information from the text related to the different types of asteroids and their presence in the asteroid belt. The text focuses on the abundance of primitive asteroids and the rarity of the differentiated ones. This conclusion is well-aligned with the text.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, which are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth.
- Differentiated asteroids have a core (mainly composed of iron) and a mantle (rocky material).
- There's a "missing mantle problem" with differentiated asteroids, meaning their mantles are hard to find in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt.
- Most intact differentiated asteroids are believed to be rare in the asteroid belt today (e.g., Vesta).
- Primitive asteroids make up a lot of the surviving objects in the asteroid belt.

Thought:
- The question is asking about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt as a whole.
- Since intact differentiated asteroids are rare, the majority of the mass would likely be in the primitive asteroids.

Criticism:
- The thought process seems logical and well based on the given information.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage does not directly provide a table, but it discusses key points related to the asteroid belt:
1. Primitive asteroids (parent bodies of chondritic meteorites) are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth. 
2. Primitive asteroids are no stronger than the mantle rocks from the differentiated asteroids.
3. Mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids are rare in the asteroid belt (called the missing mantle problem). 
4. Differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with, and none have survived. 
5. The asteroid belt today is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.

Considering these points, a conclusion can be made about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.

Analysis of choices:
A: Primitive - The passage states that most of the asteroid belt today is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron. It also mentions that primitive asteroids are the most common type of meteorite found on Earth. This choice aligns with the information provided.

B: Basaltic - The passage doesn't mention basaltic asteroids as being relevant to the mass of the asteroid belt. Basaltic asteroids are a specific composition, but their prevalence or mass in the asteroid belt isn't discussed.

C: High in reflectivity - The passage briefly references "spectra" and "reflectivity" in the context of mantle rocks, but this fact is not connected to the majority of mass in the asteroid belt. 

D: Low in reflectivity - Similar to choice C, the passage doesn't connect reflectivity to the majority mass of the asteroid belt.

Based on the thoughts and analysis, the most supported choice is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The question is asking about the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt from the available choices.

Knowledge:
The text mentions "Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron." This statement implies that the majority of the mass is in the primitive asteroids.

A: Primitive - The text states most of these objects survived, implying that the asteroid belt has a majority of the mass in primitive asteroids.
B: Basaltic - The text doesn't discuss basaltic asteroids, so we can't make a conclusion based on this.
C: High in reflectivity - The text mentions reflectivity in spectra only, but there is no indication of how it impacts the distribution of mass in the asteroid belt.
D: Low in reflectivity - The same reasoning as for C, the text discusses spectra but not its relationship to the mass of the asteroid belt.

Criticism:

The text extensively discusses how most primitive asteroids survived, suggesting that this forms the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: If Meltzer’s findings (Passage 2) are accurate, what can most reasonably be inferred about the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1?
Choices:
  A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  B: They are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
  C: They were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
  D: They may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
Passage 1 discusses the idea that a comet or asteroid impact could explain various observations, including climate cooling, the disappearance of Clovis hunters, and the near-simultaneous extinction of large mammals. The passage mentions evidence such as glass and carbon spherules, iridium levels, and carbonized material.
Passage 2 presents an opposing view, suggesting that Meltzer's research challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, as dating of the sites does not align with the Younger Dryas onset, except for three sites.

Thought: 
We are asked to infer what can reasonably be concluded about the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 if Meltzer's findings from Passage 2 are accurate.
A: If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it suggests that the timing of the glass and carbon spherules could be different from the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
B: There is no direct association between the spherules and global cooling during the Younger Dryas period in either passage.
C: Passage 1 mentions that sedimentary layers were analyzed at 25 archaeological sites, including 9 Clovis sites. It does not say that the highest concentration of spherules was at Clovis sites.
D: Neither passage implies a connection between the spherules and Clovis tool technology.

Criticism:
Based on the knowledge and thought process, Option A seems to be the most reasonable inference if Meltzer's findings (Passage 2) are accurate, as it presents a plausible alternative to the timing of the formation of glass and carbon spherules.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the evidence supporting the idea of a comet or asteroid impacting Earth around 13,000 years ago, causing global cooling and other events. Glass and carbon spherules are mentioned as part of the debris from this impact event.
  Passage 2 presents Meltzer's findings, which critically examine the dating of 29 different sites and suggest that only 3 of them actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset (around 12,800 years ago). This challenges the association of these sites with the proposed impact event.

Thoughts:
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it would mean that the majority of sites where evidence of an impact event was found do not fall into the Younger Dryas timeframe, undermining the suggested correlation between the impact and Younger Dryas events.

Options:
  A: If the majority of sites do not fall within the Younger Dryas timeframe, then the glass and carbon spherules could potentially have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas. This option aligns with Meltzer's findings.
  B: The spherules are not described as a product of global cooling in either passage. Rather, they are described as debris from a potential impact event. This option does not directly relate to Meltzer's findings.
  C: Although Clovis sites are mentioned in Passage 1, there is no explicit mention of a higher concentration of spherules found at these sites compared to others. This option does not directly relate to Meltzer's findings.
  D: Neither passage discusses any potential role the glass and carbon spherules may have played in the tool technology of the Clovis people. This option does not directly relate to Meltzer's findings.

Criticism: 
  The thought process accurately reflects the implications of Meltzer's findings on the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1. Option A seems most aligned with Meltzer's findings and addresses the potential dating discrepancy.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 mentions that the team found evidence of glass and carbon spherules in sedimentary layers at archaeological sites and suggests that they were formed as a result of the Younger Dryas impact. 
  Passage 2 describes that Meltzer's findings focused on the dating of the Younger Dryas event and found that only 3 out of 29 sites fit the time frame, indicating that the proposed impact hypothesis may not be accurate. 

Thought:
  Meltzer's findings challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which was supported by the presence of glass and carbon spherules. Since the dating of sites and the onset of the Younger Dryas are not consistent, it's reasonable to assume that these spherules could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas, making choice A the most relevant.

Criticism:
  The thought process is sound and well-reasoned considering the information from both passages.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Passage 1 mentions that certain features of the sedimentary layers at archaeological sites suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact, including glass and carbon spherules.

Passage 2 explains that David Meltzer and his team argue the dating of the 29 different sites is inaccurate, and only three of them actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset. The rest of the sites were earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.

A: This option implies that the glass and carbon spherules could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas if Meltzer's findings are accurate. This is a reasonable inference because it takes into account the dating inaccuracies mentioned in Passage 2.

B: This option claims that the glass and carbon spherules are a product of the global cooling during the Younger Dryas period. This is not supported by either passage, as the spherules are mentioned as evidence for an extraterrestrial impact, not as a direct result of the cooling event.

C: This option says that the glass and carbon spherules were found in the highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites. This statement is unsupported by either passage, as the concentration of these materials is not discussed specifically for Clovis sites.

D: This option suggests that the glass and carbon spherules may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people. This is not a claim made in either passage. The focus is on the evidence for a cosmic impact and its potential connection to the Younger Dryas period, not the tool technology of the Clovis people.

Given this analysis, the most reasonable inference if Meltzer's findings are accurate is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  In Passage 1, it states that certain features of the layers suggest they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact which includes spherules of glass and carbon. 
  In Passage 2, it states that Meltzer's team found that when the quality and accuracy of the dating are examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset. Most of the rest were earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.

Thought: 
  If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it implies that the evidence found in many sites may not be associated with the beginning of the Younger Dryas. This means the spherules of glass and carbon mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

Criticism: 
  The thought process is logical and considers the information from both passages.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Passage 1 information:
- Comet or asteroid exploded over northern ice cap 13,000 years ago, causing climate cooling and extinction of large mammals.
- Sedimentary layers at archaeological sites contain glass and carbon spherules and higher amounts of iridium, indicating possible extraterrestrial impact.

Passage 2 information:
- Meltzer's findings question the accuracy of dating for sites with evidence of cosmic collision, as only three out of the 29 sites actually fall within the Younger Dryas onset time frame.

Now let's analyze the options:

A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
- This option seems plausible because Meltzer's findings suggest that not all of the sites with the evidence of cosmic collision fall within the accurate time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.

B: They are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
- This option does not follow logically from Meltzer's findings, which question the dating of the sites rather than the connection between glass and carbon spherules and global cooling.

C: They were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
- Passage 1 provides information that glass and carbon spherules were found at archaeological sites, but it doesn't specifically mention the highest concentrations being at Clovis sites.

D: They may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.
- Neither passage mentions any connection between the glass and carbon spherules and the tool technology of the Clovis people.

So the most reasonable inference is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Passage 1:

- Researchers presented studies arguing that a comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern ice cap almost 13,000 years ago causing temperatures to plunge (Younger Dryas period) and affecting the Clovis hunters and large mammals.
- They suggest this idea because of the discovery of geochemical sedimentary layers, which include spherules of glass and carbon and high levels of iridium.

Passage 2:
- Meltzer challenges the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis by examining the dating of 29 different sites where impact advocates have reported evidence.
- Only 3 of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset (about 12,800 years ago). The rest are either earlier or later by hundreds or thousands of years.

Choices:
A: Glass and carbon spherules could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
B: The spherules are a product of the global cooling that occurred during the Younger Dryas period.
C: The spherules were found in highest concentrations at Clovis archaeological sites.
D: The spherules may have played some role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.

Thought:
- If Meltzer's findings are accurate, then much of the evidence for the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis was found at sites that were not necessarily from the Younger Dryas period.
- Consequently, the spherules of glass and carbon could have formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

Criticism:
- No flaws in facts, logic, and reasoning detected.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
First, let's analyze each option:
  A: If Meltzer's findings are accurate, it implies that the dating of the impact evidence is not reliable and may not coincide with the Younger Dryas onset. Therefore, it's possible that the glass and carbon spherules could have been formed at a different time.
  B: Glass and carbon spherules are mentioned as potential evidence of an extraterrestrial impact, not as a product of global cooling during the Younger Dryas.
  C: The last paragraph of Passage 1 discusses evidence at 25 archaeological sites across North America, but it doesn't say that the concentration of glass and carbon spherules is highest at Clovis sites.
  D: The glass and carbon spherules are evidence related to an extraterrestrial impact, not mentioned as playing a role in the tool technology of the Clovis people.

Thought process:
  The main finding of Meltzer's study is that most of the sites where impact evidence was found were improperly dated, and only three of them fell within the correct time frame. Therefore, evidence found at the other sites, such as glass and carbon spherules, could have been formed at a different time than the Younger Dryas onset.

  Therefore, choice A best answers the question based on the information given in both passages.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 states that scientists presented studies arguing that a comet or asteroid exploded above the northern ice cap, causing debris with glass and carbon spherules. The passage says that certain features of the layers suggest that they contain debris formed by an extraterrestrial impact.

  Passage 2 discusses Meltzer's findings, which involve examining the dating of 29 different sites where impact advocates reported evidence for a cosmic collision. The team argues that only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.

Thought:
  Meltzer's findings challenge the dating of the sites where the glass and carbon spherules were found, stating that only three of the 29 sites fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset.

  A: Since Meltzer's findings suggest that many of the sites do not fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, it can be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  B: Passage 1 doesn't mention that the glass and carbon spherules are a product of global cooling; it connects them to an extraterrestrial impact.
  C: Passage 1 mentions geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers found at 25 archaeological sites across North America, with 9 of them identified as Clovis, but doesn't specifically say that the spherules were found in highest concentrations at these sites.
  D: Neither passage suggests a connection between the glass and carbon spherules and the tool technology of the Clovis people.

Criticism:
  The thought process is clear and based on the information given in both passages. It focuses on the dating of the sites and the connection between the glass and carbon spherules and the Younger Dryas.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Relevant Information:
Passage 1: The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth.
Passage 2: Meltzer and his team argue that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..

Thought process:
- Meltzer's findings suggest that some of the sites dated to the beginning of the Younger Dryas may not be accurate. 
- If this is true, it could mean that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

Answer: 
By connecting the information and going through the thought process, the best choice is:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?
Question: In Passage 2, the author claims that freedoms granted by society's leaders have
Choices:
  A: privileged one gender over the other.
  B: resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue.
  C: caused arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: ensured equality for all people.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of women and the need for their education.
  A: The passage implies that society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other.
  B: The passage states that the lack of education for women could stop the progress of knowledge and virtue.
  C: The passage mentions that the exclusion of women from government is a political phenomenon, but it doesn't explicitly mention arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: The passage contends that the current situation leads to subjugation of women, not equality.

Thought Process:
  The passage argues for the rights of women and their education. The author claims that the current setup in society privileges one gender over the other, which ultimately hinders the progress of knowledge and virtue.

Criticism:
  The statement in the passage that best matches the choices is about society's leaders privileging one gender over the other. The other choices do not align as well with the passage's content.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of women and contends that a lack of education and opportunities for women prevents the progress of knowledge and virtue.
  A: Privileged one gender over the other - This choice aligns with the author's argument that women are excluded from certain rights that men enjoy.
  B: Resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue - The passage argues that denying women rights hinders the progress of knowledge and virtue, not that society's leaders have caused a general reduction in individual virtue.
  C: Caused arguments about the nature of happiness - The passage does not mention arguments about the nature of happiness as a result of freedoms granted by society's leaders.
  D: Ensured equality for all people - The passage argues against this, stating that women are not treated equally to men and are denied certain rights.

Thought:
  The author of Passage 2 claims that women are not treated equally, and by denying them certain rights and opportunities, society is hindering the progress of knowledge and virtue. Thus, choice A aligns with the author's arguments.

Criticism:
  There are no flaws in the facts or reasoning presented above. Answer A aligns with the main argument in Passage 2.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Recap:
Passage 2 argues for the rights of women and states that if women are not properly educated to be man's companion, it would hinder the progress of knowledge and virtue. The author contends that to see one half of the human race (women) excluded from the participation of government is difficult to explain based on abstract principles and that the rights of women should be considered similar to men.

Choices:
A: Privileged one gender over the other - This choice aligns with the theme in Passage 2, where the author suggests that women are not given equal opportunities as men.
B: Resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue - Passage 2 discusses how the exclusion of women in areas like education might hinder progress in knowledge and virtue, but it doesn't imply that freedoms granted lead to a reduction in individual virtue.
C: Caused arguments about the nature of happiness - This statement is not explicitly mentioned in Passage 2.
D: Ensured equality for all people - This statement is contrary to the theme of Passage 2, where the author is arguing for greater equality, indicating that it is not currently ensured for all.

Thought:
Passage 2 focuses on arguing for the rights of women, which implies that society's leaders have not adequately provided equal opportunities to both genders.

Criticism:
None.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 2 is arguing for the rights of women, as well as their right to be educated.
  A: The passage discusses the issue of one gender (males) excluding the other (females) from participation in government and how it is unjust.
  B: The passage talks about how the education and situation of women prevents them from understanding and promoting virtues.
  C: The passage does not specifically mention arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: The passage argues that women are currently being denied civil and political rights, meaning that equality is not being ensured.

Thought:
  The passage specifically mentions that women are being excluded from participation in government and are denied civil and political rights. This supports the idea that the passage claims freedoms granted by society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other, which is option A.

Criticism:
  The analysis is accurate, and option A is the best representation of what the author is claiming in Passage 2 about the freedoms granted by society's leaders.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Passage analysis:
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of women and how their lack of education and involvement in society has hindered the progress of knowledge and virtue. The author suggests that women should be allowed to partake in civil and political rights and should not be excluded from understanding their duties and their connection to their well-being.

Answer analysis:
  A: Privileged one gender over the other - This option aligns with the author's claim that women are being denied civil and political rights that men enjoy.
  B: Resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue - While the author argues that the denial of women's rights hampers the progress of knowledge and virtue, they do not specifically claim that it causes a general reduction in individual virtue.
  C: Caused arguments about the nature of happiness - The passage does not mention arguments about the nature of happiness.
  D: Ensured equality for all people - This statement contradicts the author's claim that women are being denied their rights and are not treated equally.

Based on the passage and the evaluation of each choice, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Recollection:
  Passage 2 discusses the rights of women and argues that if they are not educated to become the companion of man, it will hinder the progress of knowledge and virtue. The author states that it is inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women even if it is believed to promote their happiness. The author supports the idea of allowing women to participate in political matters and questions the exclusive authority given to men.

Choices analysis:
  A: This option implies that the author acknowledges the unequal treatment of men and women. The passage does discuss the rights of women and criticizes the limitations placed on them, supporting this view.
  
  B: The passage suggests that not educating women and denying them participation in politics may lead to a reduction in knowledge and virtue, but it doesn't specifically mention that freedoms granted have resulted in such a reduction. This option doesn't fully capture the author's argument.

  C: The passage doesn't focus on arguments about the nature of happiness. Instead, it focuses on the importance of educating women and their participation in political matters.

  D: The passage argues that women are not treated equally and criticizes the denial of their civil and political rights. This option is not correct because the passage expresses that women are denied equal rights, not that equality has been ensured for all.

Thought:
  The author of Passage 2 emphasizes the importance of educating women and their proper participation in political matters. The author claims that not allowing women to participate leads to an unjust treatment and hinders the progress of knowledge and virtue. Thus, option A aligns with the author's argument about freedoms granted by society's leaders, privileging one gender over the other.

Criticism:
  My thought process and analysis of the options seem sound and accurate in understanding the author's argument in Passage 2. The best choice among the available options appears to be option A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Recap:
Passage 2 discusses the rights of women and how their education and participation in society are essential for the progress of knowledge and virtue. The author argues that women's understanding of their duties and rights is necessary for them to contribute effectively to society. They also challenge the notion that one gender should have exclusive power over the other and address the inconsistency of granting freedom to men while subjugating women.

Choices analysis:
A: privileged one gender over the other - This choice aligns with the author's argument that women are being excluded by men from participation in government and civil rights, as well as the claim that there is hypocrisy in allowing men to judge for themselves their happiness while subjugating women.
B: resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue - The passage does touch on the idea of virtue, but the author argues that the exclusion of women reduces progress and knowledge. There is no mention of a general reduction in individual virtue resulting from the freedoms granted by society's leaders.
C: caused arguments about the nature of happiness - The passage does not specifically discuss arguments about the nature of happiness. The focus is on the inconsistencies and hypocrisy in granting freedom to men while subjugating women.
D: ensured equality for all people - This choice contradicts the passage's message, as the author argues that women are being unjustly excluded from political and civil rights and that the situation does not provide equality for all.

Thought:
The author of Passage 2 is arguing that the exclusion of women from participation in government and civil rights has privileged one gender over the other, which is consistent with choice A.

Criticism:
There are no flaws in the thought process and the answer aligns with the author's main arguments in Passage 2.

Action: Answer("A")

- The author discusses how the current state of society denies women participation in government (half the human race excluded by the other).
- The author points out that by denying women their rights, society may be stopping the progress of knowledge and virtue.
- The author questions the right of men to be the exclusive judge of women's happiness.

Thought:
- Option A mentions the privileging of one gender over the other, which matches the argument in Passage 2 about women being excluded from participating in the government, as well as the questioning of men's right to be the exclusive judge of women's happiness.
- Option B talks about a general reduction in individual virtue, which may relate to the point that denying women’s rights could stop the progress of knowledge and virtue, but it is not the main focus of the passage.
- Option C mentions arguments about the nature of happiness. Although happiness is discussed in the passage, this is not a focal point of the author's argument, and their main focus is on rights, education, and equality.
- Option D states that freedoms have ensured equality for all people, which is the opposite of the author's argument in Passage 2, as they claim that women are denied equal rights and participation in the government.

Criticism:
- Based on the main focus and context of Passage 2, Option A seems to best fit the author's argument that society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Recall:
  Passage 2 discusses the importance of women's rights and equality with men. The author emphasizes the crucial role of women in the education and development of society. They argue that women must understand the principles of patriotism and how it is connected to their real good.

Review Choices:
  A: privileged one gender over the other - This aligns with the author's argument about women being excluded from certain rights and opportunities.
  
  B: resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue - The author does mention that excluding women from knowledge and development may "stop the progress of knowledge and virtue", but this choice does not accurately represent the author's overall focus on the inequality between genders.
  
  C: caused arguments about the nature of happiness - The author discusses happiness but does not mention that freedoms granted by society's leaders have caused arguments about happiness.
  
  D: ensured equality for all people - Passage 2 argues against this idea, as the author critiques the lack of rights and equality for women in society.

Thought:
  The author in Passage 2 highlights the inequality between men and women, arguing that society's leaders have favored one gender over the other. Therefore, the best answer is A: privileged one gender over the other.

Criticism:
  Considering the context and arguments presented in Passage 2, the choice A accurately represents the author's claim about the impact of freedoms granted by society's leaders.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Follow the money and you will end up in space. That's the message from a first-of-its-kind forum on mining beyond Earth.Convened in Sydney by the Australian Centre for 5 Space Engineering Research, the event brought together mining companies, robotics experts, lunar scientists, and government agencies that are all working to make space mining a reality.The forum comes hot on the heels of the 102012 unveiling of two private asteroid-mining firms. Planetary Resources of Washington says it will launch its first prospecting telescopes in two years, while Deep Space Industries of Virginia hopes to be harvesting metals from asteroids by 2020 . Another15 commercial venture that sprung up in 2012, Golden Spike of Colorado, will be offering trips to the moon, including to potential lunar miners.Within a few decades, these firms may be meeting earthly demands for precious metals, such as20 platinum and gold, and the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium and lanthanum. But like the gold rush pioneers who transformed the western United States, the first space miners won't just enrich themselves. They also hope25 to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects.In this scenario, water mined from other 30 worlds could become the most desired commodity. "In the desert, what's worth more: a kilogram of gold or a kilogram of water?" asks Kris Zacny of HoneyBee Robotics in New York. "Gold is useless. Water will let you live."35 Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield. Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary 40 refuelling stations. Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery. Others want to turn space dirt into 45 concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads.\section{Passage 2}The motivation for deep-space travel is shifting from discovery to economics. The past year has seen a flurry of proposals aimed at bringing celestial riches down to Earth. No doubt this will make a few0 billionaires even wealthier, but we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all.But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought. At first glance, space55 mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns: there is (probably!) no life on asteroids, and thus no habitats to trash. But its consequences -both here on Earth and in space -merit careful consideration.60 Part of this is about principles. Some will argue that space's "magnificent desolation" is not ours to despoil, just as they argue that our own planet's poles should remain pristine. Others will suggest that glutting ourselves on space's riches is not an65 acceptable alternative to developing more sustainable ways of earthly life.History suggests that those will be hard lines to hold, and it may be difficult to persuade the public that such barren environments are worth preserving.70 After all, they exist in vast abundance, and even fewer people will experience them than have walked through Antarctica's icy landscapes.There's also the emerging off-world economy to consider. The resources that are valuable in orbit and 75 beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. Questions of their stewardship have barely been broached-and the relevant legal and regulatory framework is fragmentary, to put it mildly.Space miners, like their earthly counterparts, are 80 often reluctant to engage with such questions.One speaker at last week's space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with a plea that regulation should be avoided. But miners have much to gain from a broad agreement on the for-profit 85 exploitation of space. Without consensus, claims will be disputed, investments risky, and the gains made insecure. It is in all of our long-term interests to seek one out

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice
Question: Which question was Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily intended to answer?
Choices:
  A: Does the act of memorization make use of different brain structures than does the act of navigation?
  B: Do mental athletes inherit their unusual brain structures, or do the structures develop as a result of specific activities?
  C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?
  D: What is the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes?
Response 0:
Relevant knowledge: 
  Maguire's study of mental athletes was conducted to see whether their brains were structurally different from the brains of other people or if they just used their memory abilities differently. She had previously studied London cab drivers and found that their brains had a larger right posterior hippocampus responsible for spatial navigation.

Thought process:
  Going through the text, we can see the objective of Maguire's study was mentioned as: "They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were - like the London cabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess."

  Comparing this objective to the choices given:
  A: While the study did find that mental athletes used different neural circuitry for memorization, this was not the primary question the study aimed to answer.
  B: The study does focus on whether the structure develops as a result of activities but not on the inheritance of the unusual brain structures. It partially reflects the intent of the research question but is not the most accurate answer.
  C: This answer fits well with the objective provided in the passage, as it directly addresses whether the heightened memorization ability of mental athletes is due to abnormal brain structures or unusual use of normal brain structures.
  D: General cognitive ability was mentioned, but the primary intent was not about the relationship between unusual brain structures and general cognitive ability; it was about understanding the heightened memorization abilities of mental athletes.

Criticism:
  Revisiting the text and the explanations for each choice confirms that choice C accurately reflects the primary question Maguire's study aimed to answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Maguire studied the brains of London taxi drivers, finding a larger right posterior hippocampus, known for spatial navigation.
- She then decided to study mental athletes, teaming up with Valentine and Wilding.
- Their goal was to find out if the mental athlete's brains were structurally different or if they were making better use of memory abilities.

Thought:
- Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily aimed to establish whether their brains were structurally different or if they used regular brain structures in a unique way for memory.
- Therefore, the primary question Maguire's study aimed to answer is: "Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?"

Criticism:
- The thought process is clear and reasonable, leading to the correct conclusion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to understand the differences between their brains and those of non-mental athletes.
A: This option focuses on whether memorization and navigation use different brain structures in general, but not specifically about mental athletes.
B: This option focuses on the inheritance aspect of the unusual brain structures and whether they develop as a result of specific activities.
C: This is the primary focus of Maguire's study, which examines whether heightened memorization ability is due to abnormal brain structure or different utilization of normal brain structure.
D: This option focuses on general cognitive ability and its relationship to unusual brain structures in mental athletes, but it's not necessarily the primary focus of Maguire's study.

Thought:
Maguire's study of mental athletes primarily aimed to answer whether their memorization abilities were a result of abnormal brain structure or simply an unusual use of normal brain structures. The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?

Criticism:
The choice C is the most accurate description of Maguire's primary question in her study of mental athletes. The passage states that the purpose of her research was to find out "if the memorizers' brains were... structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess."

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Relevant knowledge:
  Eleanor Maguire studied taxi drivers to see the effect of navigating London streets on their brains.
  She found that the right posterior hippocampus (associated with spatial navigation) was larger in cabbies.
  Next, she studied mental athletes to see if their brains were structurally different from other people's brains.
  She and her team found no significant structural differences but identified different brain activation patterns in mental athletes.

Thought:
  Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to identify whether their heightened memorization ability was due to abnormal brain structures or unusual use of normal brain structures.

Criticism:
  My analysis correctly captures the purpose of Maguire's study of mental athletes.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  Maguire studied the brains of taxi drivers, and found their right posterior hippocampus to be 7% larger than normal, which is related to spatial navigation.
  Maguire teamed up with Valentine and Wilding to study mental athletes who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were structurally different or if they were just making better use of memory abilities.

Thought:
  The key question of Maguire's study of mental athletes was to determine whether their brains were structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were simply making better use of memory abilities that we all possess. The focus was on understanding if their heightened memorization ability was due to abnormal brain structure or due to an unusual use of normal brain structure.

  Therefore, the answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?

Criticism:
  The thought process is accurate, and the explanation provided supports the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Maguire conducted a study on London cabbies, and found a correlation between their mental navigation and changes in their brain structure.
- Maguire decided to study mental athletes to understand if their brains were structurally different or if they were making better use of memory abilities that everyone possesses.
- Maguire initially thought that mental athletes might have structurally different brains due to their intensive training and memorization skills, but found no significant difference.
- Mental athletes used different brain circuitry for visual memory and spatial navigation, but their brain structures were not different from the control group.

Thought process:
The study on mental athletes is primarily focused on understanding if their memorization ability is a result of abnormal brain structure or if it is about using their normal brain structure differently.
Therefore, the correct answer should be related to whether the heightened memorization ability is due to brain structure or if it's just a different usage of the normal brain structure.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Maguire's study of mental athletes was conducted in collaboration with Elizabeth Valentine and John Wilding. They focused on individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship.
  A: This option is about the difference between memorization and navigation in brain structures.
  B: This option is about whether mental athletes inherit unusual brain structures or develop them through specific activities.
  C: This option is about the relationship between heightened memorization ability and abnormal brain structure or unusual use of normal brain structure.
  D: This option is about the relationship between general cognitive ability and unusual brain structures of mental athletes.

Thought:
  Paragraph 3 of the text mentions Maguire's intention: "They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the London cabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess."

Criticism:
  My understanding of the text and options aligns with the correct interpretation. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Recap:
  A: The act of memorization possibly making use of different brain structures than the act of navigation is not the primary focus of the study but was one aspect she looked into with mental athletes.
  B: Inheritance of unusual brain structures or their development as a result of specific activities was not the primary focus of the study, but it did touch upon if these structures developed owing to intensive remembering.
  C: Maguire's primary intention was to understand if mental athletes' brains were structurally different or were making better use of memory abilities that we all possess. This choice aligns with this intention as it questions whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  D: The study only mentioned that mental athletes' scores came back within the normal range on every test of general cognitive ability, but it was not the primary focus of the study.

Thought:
  Maguire focused on understanding if there were structural differences in mental athletes' brains compared to normal subjects or if they were using memory abilities differently. Choice C directly addresses this by questioning if heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.

Criticism:
  The recap and thought process are consistent with the provided text. Thus, choice C aligns with the primary intention of Maguire's study.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Maguire initially studied London cabbies' brains to see if driving the labyrinthine streets affected their brain structure.
- In her study of mental athletes, Maguire teamed up with Elizabeth Valentine and John Wilding to investigate the top finishers of the World Memory Championship.
- Her main question was whether mental athletes' brains had structural differences from average people or if they used memory abilities we all possess in a more efficient way.

Thought:
- All choices are related to the brain functions involved in memorization and navigation.
- Choice A focuses on comparing memorization and navigation, but the study's primary aim was to explore the brain structure of mental athletes.
- Choice B raises the question of whether mental athletes have inherited brain structure or if they have developed them through specific activities. This is not the primary focus of the study.
- Choice C evaluates whether mental athletes have an abnormal, or unusual, brain structure or if they use their normal brain structure in an unusual way. This is the main focus of the study.
- Choice D focuses on the relationship between general cognitive ability and unusual brain structures of mental athletes, which is not the primary intention of the study.

Criticism:
- The thought process seems accurate, and there are no flaws in facts, logic, or reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Relevant Knowledge: 
  Maguire studied mental athletes who participated in the World Memory Championship.
  She previously studied London cabbies and found that their right posterior hippocampus was larger, directly associated with their spatial navigation abilities.
  Maguire and her team wanted to find out if there were structural differences in the brains of mental athletes as well.
  
Thought Process:
  A: The study was not primarily focused on comparing the brain structures related to memorization and navigation.
  B: The study aimed to find potential structural differences in mental athletes' brains, but the question was not about whether they inherited these differences.
  C: The primary focus of the study was to determine if the mental athletes possessed any abnormal brain structure or if they utilized normal brain structure in an unusual way.
  D: The study did not primarily focus on the relationship between general cognitive ability and the unusual brain structures of mental athletes.

Criticism:
  The thought process and relevant knowledge are accurate and logically reasoned.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, what potential criticism might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model?
Choices:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
Response 0:
Relevant Information:
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that flytraps store information regarding hairs being touched in the electric charge of its leaf. The trap requires a high concentration of calcium to close and single action potential doesn't reach this level. A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total calcium concentration over the threshold.
  
  Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated it is electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close using fine electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, making the trap close without direct touch to its trigger hairs. They didn't measure calcium levels, but the current likely led to increases. When they modify the experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, they could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.

Thought:
  Volvok's test supports Hodick and Sievers's model as it also shows that an electrical current can cause the Venus flytrap to close. His experiments were focused on the direct application of an electrical current, and although they didn't specifically measure calcium concentrations during their experiment, the currents applied likely led to the necessary increases in calcium concentration.

Criticism:
  Potential criticism of Volkov's testing might be that he didn't directly measure the calcium levels during his experiments, which is a key aspect of Hodick and Sievers's model.

Answer: B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
- Volkov and his colleagues conducted a test by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. The test showed that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close.
- Volkov determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.

Thought:
A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  - Based on the passage, Volkov correctly understood the model and tested it, showcasing that electricity could cause the trap to close.
  
B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  - Volkov's measurements actually did support Hodick and Sievers's model. His experiment showed that electricity is the key factor for trap closure, which is not contradicting their model.

C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  - There is no indication in the passage that Hodick and Sievers would have objected to the direct application of an electrical current. Moreover, the test was to further support their model.

D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
  - While true that Hodick and Sievers developed their model at an earlier time than Volkov's experiment, this statement does not constitute criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.

The best choice among these options would be the one that points out an issue with Volkov's test in relation to Hodick and Sievers's model. The first two options do not accurately address any problems with Volkov's test, and the fourth option does not constitute a criticism.

Criticism:
None of these choices are directly critical of Volkov's testing. However, one choice could be seen as an indirectly related to criticism:

C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  
This choice implies that there might be a problem with Volkov's method of applying an electrical current, as it was not the natural way the Venus flytrap would have functioned (trigger hairs being touched).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses how the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information of touches by insects to decide whether it should close its trap. 
  Hodick and Sievers's model proposes that the flytrap stores information about the touched hairs in the electric charge of its leaf, with a high enough concentration of calcium required for the trap to close.
  Volkov and his colleagues tested the model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, making it close without direct touch to its trigger hairs. They determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.

Thought:
  A: There is no indication in the passage that Volkov misunderstood Hodick and Sievers's model; in fact, he tested their model by applying electrical current to the trap.
  B: Volkov's measurements helped determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close, which supports Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Although Volkov applied an electrical current directly to the Venus flytrap, the passage does not reveal that Hodick and Sievers would object to this method of testing their model.
  D: The availability of Volkov's technology to Hodick and Sievers is not a criticism of Volkov's testing of the model. Volkov used the technology available in his time to test and support their model.

Criticism: 
  None of the options seem to present a criticism that is supported by the passage. Still, as per the rules, I must select an answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model: their theory is that the trap stores information about how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf (lines 35-41), and that the trap requires a specific high concentration of calcium to close, with the concentration of calcium ions dissipating over time (lines 57-64).

  Volkov's experiments involved applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the Venus flytrap, making it close without direct touch to the trigger hairs (lines 70-73). The passage does not report any objections or concerns regarding Volkov's methods from Hodick and Sievers or indicate that they considered it objectionable.

  The text mentions that subsequent research by Volkov and his colleagues supports Hodick and Sievers's model (lines 65-66).

  A: There is no indication in the passage that Volkov misunderstood Hodick and Sievers's model.
  B: Volkov's measurements seem to confirm, rather than contradict, Hodick and Sievers's findings.
  C: There is no suggestion in the passage that Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.
  D: While Volkov's technology may not have been available to Hodick and Sievers, the passage does not present this as a criticism of Volkov's experiment.

Thought:
  The passage does not state any potential criticism made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.

  The passage does state that the subsequent research supports Hodick and Sievers's model, implying that there might be a collaborative and validating relationship between Volkov's experiments and Hodick and Sievers's research.

  From the available choices, none of them criticize Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.

Criticism:
  After evaluating the knowledge and thoughts, it can be concluded that there might not be any major criticism against Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model, as he supports their original findings.

Analysis of Options:
  A: Incorrect. Volkov's experiments appear to have accurately built upon the original model created by Hodick and Sievers.
  B: Incorrect. Volkov's measurements support Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: Incorrect. There's no evidence in the passage that suggests Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methodology.
  D: Incorrect. Volkov's technology, while not available to Hodick and Sievers, was used to confirm and build upon the original model rather than being a potential point of criticism.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University tested Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding touches in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Volkov's experiment involved applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap to make it close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs.
  
Thought:

Potential Criticism based on the passage:
  One potential criticism might be that Volkov did not measure calcium levels during the experiment, which is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. However, this criticism option is not provided in the given choices.

Based on the information provided in the passage and the given choices:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  Hodick and Sievers proposed a model in which the flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Volkov's experiment involved applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, which made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs.
  Volkov determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close by altering the amount of electrical current.

Thought:
  The passage doesn't mention any misunderstanding of Hodick and Sievers's model by Volkov.
  Choice A can be eliminated.
  Volkov's measurements demonstrated that it is electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, which is in agreement with Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Choice B can be eliminated.
  The passage does not mention any objections from Hodick and Sievers regarding Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.
  Choice C can be eliminated.
  The only potential criticism is that Volkov's technology for applying electrical current to the trap was not mentioned to be available to Hodick and Sievers. This is indicated in the passage when it states, "Subsequent research supports this model" and then describes Volkov's experiment.

Criticism:
  The passage does not mention any criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  Option D raises the point about Volkov's technology being not available to Hodick and Sievers.
  However, this is not a criticism of Volkov's testing, but rather a difference in the technology available during their respective research periods.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Hodick and Sievers's model: the flytrap stores information regarding hair touches in the electric charge of its leaf and requires calcium ion concentrations threshold to close.
  Volkov's testing: demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close and determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close using electrodes and electrical current.

Thought:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was not mentioned to be incorrect in the passage.
  B: Volkov's measurements helped determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  C: The passage does not mention that Hodick and Sievers would object to Volkov's method of using direct electrical current.
  D: While Volkov's technology may not have been available to Hodick and Sievers, it does not imply criticism in their model.

Criticism:
  A potential criticism might be that Volkov's test did not measure calcium levels directly, only that electricity caused the trap to close. The relationship between electrical current and calcium ion concentrations is central to Hodick and Sievers's model.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Hodick and Sievers proposed a model that the Venus flytrap stores information about the touched hairs based on the electric charge of its leaf and the concentration of calcium ions.
- Volkov and his colleagues conducted an experiment by applying an electrical current directly to the trap's open lobes, causing the trap to close without touching the trigger hairs.

Thought:
- The question asks about a potential criticism of Volkov's testing method in light of Hodick and Sievers's model.
- Choice A suggests that Volkov did not fully understand the model, which is not supported by the passage.
- Choice B states that the measurements taken by Volkov do not collaborate with Hodick and Sievers's model, but there is no evidence in the passage to suggest that.
- Choice C suggests that Hodick and Sievers might object to the method of applying electrical current directly to the trap, which is a possibility as it does not involve the natural triggering mechanism.
- Choice D is irrelevant since it's not important for Volkov to use technology available to Hodick and Sievers; rather, the focus should be on the accuracy of testing their model.

Criticism:
- Eliminate A and B, as there is no evidence in the passage to support these choices.
- Eliminate D, as the availability of technology is not relevant.
- C seems the most logical answer since it raises a legitimate concern about the method being potentially objectionable due to bypassing the natural triggering mechanism of Venus flytrap.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage is about how the Venus flytrap works and the theory of encoding information.
  Hodick and Sievers proposed a model where the number of hairs touched is stored in the electric charge of the flytrap's leaf.
  Volkov and his colleagues tested this model by directly applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, which made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs.
  Volkov found the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.

Thought process:
  A: Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers' model is not criticized in the passage.; his testing was based on their model.
  B: Volkov's measurements supported Hodick and Sievers' model by demonstrating that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close.
  C: The passage does not mention any objections from Hodick and Sievers regarding Volkov's direct application of an electrical current. It's not clear if this would be a concern for them.
  D: Volkov's technology might not have been available to Hodick and Sievers, but this is not a criticism of Volkov's testing of their model. It only states that Volkov was able to prove the model using more advanced technology.

Criticism:
  No flaws were found in the thought process.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Hodick and Sievers's model explains that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close its trap. A single action potential from one trigger hair being touched does not reach the required threshold level of calcium, hence a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  
  Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama demonstrated that it is electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. They applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap without directly touching the trigger hairs, thus causing the trap to close. They didn't measure calcium levels during their experiment.

Thought:
  A: There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.
  B: Volkov's measurements did not directly measure the calcium levels in the plant, which is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  C: The passage does not mention any objections from Hodick and Sievers regarding the direct application of electrical current by Volkov.
  D: The passage does not mention any differences in technology availability between Volkov and Hodick and Sievers.

Criticism:
  Since the passage does not indicate any inaccurate understanding of the model by Volkov or objections from Hodick and Sievers, A and C can be eliminated. Also, the passage does not mention technology availability differences, so D seems unrelated.

  Choice B, however, points out that Volkov's measurements did not directly address a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, which is the calcium levels in the Venus flytrap. This could be seen as a potential criticism of his testing of the model.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: Based on the passage, which action would most likely reducepolitical extremism among the citizenry?
Choices:
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions
  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held
  C: Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes
  D: Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the illusion of explanatory depth, where people believe they understand complex matters when they don't, leading to false and extreme beliefs that shape preferences, judgments, and actions, including votes. 
  It suggests that forcing people to articulate the mechanics of complex policies might confront their ignorance and weaken extremist stands on issues.
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions does not challenge their beliefs or force them to consider the complexities of policies.
  B: Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail could expose the intricacies of the policies, potentially reducing extremism. 
  C: Promoting awareness of charities does not directly focus on addressing political extremism or challenging political beliefs.
  D: Hosting events that encourage interaction between people who hold opposing points of view may create dialogue but does not force them to confront the complexities of policies or their own ignorance.

Thought:
  The question asks which action would most likely reduce political extremism among citizens.
  Based on the passage, confronting ignorance by elaborating on policy mechanics was shown to be an effective way to reduce extremism, thus requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail fits that criterion.

Criticism:
  The reasoning aligns with the information provided in the passage and no flaws are found in the logic.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the illusion of explanatory depth, where people have simplistic understanding of complex issues and are confident about it.
  The study by Fernbach and his colleagues aimed to see if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might make them confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The result showed that when people tried and failed to explain complex policies, they became more moderate in their views.
  
Thought:
  A: Forming organized groups with shared convictions might strengthen the existing views and not reduce extremism.
  B: Requiring politicians to explain policies in detail might make citizens realize the complexity of the issues and possibly reduce political extremism.
  C: Promoting awareness of charities is not directly related to reducing political extremism in the passage.
  D: Hosting events for people with opposing points of view might promote interaction but doesn't focus on understanding the complexity of issues.

Criticism: 
  The thoughts are based on the passage, and option B seems to be the most likely action to reduce political extremism among the citizenry since it's connected to the idea of explaining complex policies in detail.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that requiring people to explain complex policies in detail, considering the mechanics of implementation, could make them confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist views. Fernbach conducted experiments to test the notion that attempting and failing to explain complex policies would moderate individuals' perspectives and reduce extremism.

Thought Process:
A: Forming organized groups of people with similar convictions might reinforce their current views rather than reducing political extremism.
B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election could help citizens to have a better understanding of the policies and their implementation. This option seems aligned with the idea of explaining complex policies in detail, as described in the passage.
C: Promoting awareness of charities does not directly relate to lessening political extremism among citizens.
D: Hosting events with opposing viewpoints might expose individuals to different ideas, but it does not necessarily follow the method of explaining complex policies, which the passage demonstrated to be effective in reducing extremism.

Criticism:
  My logic seems sound, and the relevant facts support option B, as it is most aligned with the passage's findings on reducing political extremism.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses the illusion of explanatory depth and how people tend to have extreme positions on complex issues without truly understanding them.
- It mentions an experiment where participants were asked to explain complex policies in detail, which led to them realizing their lack of understanding and moderating their viewpoints.
- Fernbach believes it's the slow, cognitive work and deliberate analysis that changes people's judgments.
- It is stated that polarization reinforces itself due to people's unawareness of their ignorance, biased information processing, and interactions with like-minded individuals.
- It suggests that forcing candidates to provide concrete and elaborate plans might be a start in addressing political extremism.

Thoughts:
- The passage clearly demonstrates that having people articulate the details of complex policies can lead to a moderation of their extreme views.
- Forming groups of people who share deep convictions (Choice A) would likely increase extremism rather than reduce it.
- Promoting awareness of charities (Choice C) doesn't directly address the issue of political extremism. 
- While hosting events that encourage opposing points of view interactions (Choice D) might lead to some level of understanding, it doesn't require the type of in-depth analysis of policies that proved effective in the experiment mentioned in the passage.

Criticism: 
- The passage's focal point lies in the idea of explaining policies in detail to reduce political extremism.
- Choice B (Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held) seems to be the most aligned with this idea and has a higher likelihood of reducing extremism among citizens.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The passage focuses on the illusion of explanatory depth and how it contributes to political extremism.
- Psychological scientist Philip Fernbach conducted experiments to test if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
- The passage states that trying and failing to explain complex policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed, causing them to become more moderate in their views.
- The passage also states that if people list reasons for liking a policy instead of explaining it, their views are less shaken and they remain extreme in their opinions. 

Thought:
- We want to find the action that would most likely reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
- Option A involves forming organized groups that share their deeply held convictions, which might actually reinforce people's beliefs instead of reducing extremism.
- Option B suggests that politicians should explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held, which aligns with Philip Fernbach's experiment that found that understanding complex policies in detail weakens extremist stands on issues.
- Option C deals with promoting awareness of charities; this doesn't seem to directly address the problem of political extremism.
- Option D involves hosting events where people with opposing views can interact; although this action might encourage some dialogue, it doesn't guarantee that people will confront their own ignorance on complex issues.

Criticism:
- The given information and thought process appears to be logical and sound.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the idea that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would make them confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. 
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions would potentially strengthen their views, not reduce political extremism.
  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election could potentially give citizens a starting place and encourage them to delve into the specifics themselves, facing their ignorance and promoting moderation.
  C: Promoting awareness of charities is not directly relevant to political extremism.
  D: Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact could potentially expose them to opposing ideas but may not necessarily force them to confront their ignorance and reduce political extremism.

Thought:
  The passage's main point is that forcing individuals to confront their lack of understanding of complex policies can moderate their extreme views. 
  Option B supports this idea by having politicians explain their proposed policies in detail, which can encourage citizens to confront their ignorance and reduce political extremism.

Criticism:
  The logic and reasoning seem sound. The passage directly discusses confronting ignorance of complex policies to reduce extremism, and Option B aligns with that idea.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their deeply held convictions can strengthen their positions rather than reduce extremism.
  B: Requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election might give citizens a starting point to better understand the policies and reduce extremism.
  C: Promoting awareness of charities isn't directly related to the understanding of complex policies and political extremism.
  D: Hosting events to interact with people who hold opposing points of view could help create understanding, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the passage in relation to reducing extremism.

Thought:
  The passage states that when people are forced to explain complex policies in detail, their extremist views may be reduced. So, requiring politicians to explain their policies could potentially reduce political extremism among the citizenry.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.
  
Criticism:
  The thought process seems solid, and the conclusion is derived from evidence provided in the passage. The answer seems valid.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  The passage describes an experiment conducted by Philip Fernbach, where participants were asked to write detailed explanations of complex policies instead of merely stating their positions on the issues. It was found that this exercise made people realize their lack of understanding and ultimately led them to moderate their views.

Thought:
  We need to identify which action among the choices would most likely reduce political extremism among the citizenry, based on the information in the passage.

  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions: This option could reinforce people's beliefs and would not make them confront their lack of understanding. It is not likely to reduce political extremism.

  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held: This option is in line with what was tested in Fernbach's experiment. Making people understand the complexities involved with a policy might lead them to moderate their views. This option has the potential to reduce political extremism.

  C: Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes: This option does not address the core issue of people's lack of understanding of complex policies and would not likely have a direct impact on political extremism.

  D: Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another: While this option may expose people to different views, it does not necessarily address the underlying issue of understanding complex policies. It may lead to a softening of views, but the passage does not provide enough evidence to support this as a highly effective strategy to reduce political extremism.

Criticism:
  The thoughts and analysis seem reasonable and follow the information provided in the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the illusion of explanatory depth among voters and how it can contribute to political extremism. It also describes experiments conducted by Philip Fernbach, a psychological scientist, who wanted to explore if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.

Thought:
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions - This option might only reinforce their existing views rather than reduce extremism.
  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held - This option can potentially force the citizenry to understand the policies better, thus confronting their ignorance and reducing extremism.
  C: Promoting awareness of charities that provide opportunities to donate money to worthy but underfunded causes - This option is not directly related to reducing political extremism.
  D: Hosting events that encourage people who hold opposing points of view to interact with one another - This option might help in understanding different points of view but doesn't necessarily involve explaining policies in detail which is mentioned as an effective approach in the passage.

Criticism: 
  Based on the passage, Option B is the most relevant and likely to reduce political extremism among the citizenry, as it involves politicians providing detailed explanations of their proposed policies.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage states that when individuals were asked to explain complex policies in detail and to consider the mechanics of implementation, they confronted their own ignorance, which resulted in the weakening of their extremist stands on issues.
  A: Forming organized groups of people who share their most deeply held convictions would likely strengthen their beliefs rather than reduce extremism.
  B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held might encourage citizens to better understand policies and dampen extremism.
  C: Promoting awareness of charities does not directly relate to reducing political extremism.
  D: Hosting events for people with opposing points of view could encourage dialogue but might not lead to reducing extremism.

Thought:
  The passage demonstrates that deep-rooted convictions can be shaken when people are forced to consider the details and mechanics of policy implementation, resulting in the weakening of extremist stands.
  Option B directly relates to explaining policies in detail, which was shown in the passage to have an impact on reducing extremism.

Criticism:
  There are no flaws in the facts, logic, or reasoning presented.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

Criticism:
Each option can be evaluated in the context of Parsons's speech.
A: Parsons' speech doesn't focus on a political philosophy losing favor; rather, it focuses on his personal transformation from one ideology to another.
B: The speech does not present a new approach to meeting the needs of oppressed groups, but instead explains his shift in ideology.
C: Parsons provides a rationale for adopting a different ideology (anarchism) through sharing his experiences and thoughts.
D: Although he does mention concerns about the political system's limitations, the primary purpose of the speech is not to highlight inconsistencies within the current political system.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

Topic: English
Context: Another man might have thrown up his.hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters.acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with.Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of.a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course.knew that he must proliferate his sources of.revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni.for tending the tube wells would not even begin to.suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off.a condemned electric motor—condemned by him..He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at.the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken.radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not.demur even when asked to fix watches, though that.enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned.him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took.apart ever kept time again..K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived.mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,.Nawab would place himself night and day at the door.leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled.grove of ancient banyan trees where the old.farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator.glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the.household machinery, the air conditioners, water.heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an.engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer.in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he.almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the.same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and.lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in.Lahore..Harouni of course became familiar with this.ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on.his tours of inspection, but morning and night could.be found standing on the master bed rewiring the.light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water.heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the.psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say.a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his.nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him.to go ahead..“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to.the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube.wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is.but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have.earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to.show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties.as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive.me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud.hunger within than disgrace in the light of day..Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”.The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of.speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at.his nails and waited for the breeze to stop..“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”.Unauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. **22 CONTINUE**.“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your.service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,.on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the.many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery.fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a.bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I.first had the good fortune to enter your employment..I beg you, sir, let me go.”.“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing.that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly.care one way or the other, except that it touched on.his comfort—a matter of great interest to him..“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could.somehow limp along, at least until I train up some.younger man.”.The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt.expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the.disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a.brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even.managed to extract an allowance for gasoline..The motorcycle increased his status, gave him.weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and.asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he.knew absolutely nothing. He could now range.further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,.now he could spend every night with his wife, who.had begged to live not on the farm but near her.family in Firoza, where also they could educate at.least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road.ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way.to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni.lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new.machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every.knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,.seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial.wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to.whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears.almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his.arrival.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: Which choice best states the relationship between the two passages?

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Voters need to understand the prosaic details of.complex policies. Most have staked out positions on.these issues, but they are not often reasoned.positions, which take hard intellectual work. Most.citizens opt instead for simplistic explanations,.assuming wrongly that they comprehend the nuances.of issues..Psychological scientists have a name for this.easy, automatic, simplistic thinking: the illusion of.explanatory depth. We strongly believe that we.understand complex matters, when in fact we are.clueless, and these false and extreme beliefs.shape our preferences, judgments, and actions—.including our votes..Is it possible to shake such deep-rooted.convictions? That’s the question that Philip.Fernbach, a psychological scientist at the University.of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, wanted to.explore. Fernbach and his colleagues wondered if.forcing people to explain complex policies in.detail—not cheerleading for a position but really.considering the mechanics of implementation—.might force them to confront their ignorance and.thus weaken their extremist stands on issues. They.ran a series of lab experiments to test this idea..They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in.their 30s—Democrats, Republicans, and.Independents—and asking them to state their.positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat.tax to a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions..The volunteers indicated how strongly they felt about.each issue and also rated their own understanding of.the issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to.write elaborate explanations of two issues. If the issue.was cap and trade, for example, they would first.explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is.implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could.hurt, the sources of carbon emissions, and so forth..They were not asked for value judgments about the.policy or about the environment or business, but.only for a highly detailed description of the.mechanics of the policy in action..Let’s be honest: Most of us never do this..Fernbach’s idea was that such an exercise would.force many to realize just how little they really know.about cap and trade, and confronted with their own.ignorance, they would dampen their own.enthusiasm. They would be humbled and as a result.take less extreme positions. And that’s just what.happened. Trying—and failing—to explain complex.policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about.being well-informed. They became more moderate in.their views as a result..Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts of a.policy is not the same as trying to sell that policy..In fact, talking about one’s views can often.strengthen them. Fernbach believes it’s the slow,.cognitive work—the deliberate analysis—that.changes people’s judgments, but he wanted to check.this in another experiment. This one was very similar.to the first, but some volunteers, instead of.explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it..The results were clear. Those who simply listed.reasons for their positions—articulating their.values—were less shaken in their views. They.continued to think they understood the policies in.their complexity, and, notably, they remained.extreme in their passion for their positions..Polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are.unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out.information that bolsters their views, often without.knowing it. They also process new information in.biased ways, and they hang out with people like.themselves. All of these psychological forces increase.political extremism, and no simple measure will.change that. But forcing the candidates to provide.concrete and elaborate plans might be a start; it gives.citizens a starting place.
Question: The passage implies that when conducting his laboratorywork, Fernbach would have been most surprised by which finding?
Choices:
  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Fernbach's hypothesis was that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
- The study found that after attempting to explain complex policies, participants became more moderate.
- Fernbach tested explaining policies versus listing reasons for liking them.
- The results showed that those who simply listed reasons for their positions remained extreme in their passion for their positions.

Thought:
- A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions. This does not appear to address Fernbach's hypothesis directly.
- B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase. This would be unexpected based on the hypothesis, but it does not focus on the extremity of views.
- C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise. This actually supports Fernbach's findings as participants who listed reasons remained extreme in their positions.
- D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them. This would directly contradict Fernbach's hypothesis, as he expected extremist views to weaken after explaining complex policies.

Criticism:
- Option D most directly contradicts Fernbach's hypothesis and would be the most surprising finding for him.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the experiment conducted by psychological scientist Philip Fernbach.
  Fernbach's hypothesis was that if people were forced to explain complex policies in detail, they would confront their ignorance, dampen their enthusiasm, and take less extreme positions.
  The experiment showed that attempting to explain complex policies made participants more moderate in their views.
  In a follow-up experiment, merely listing reasons for liking a policy strengthened participants' views instead of weakening them.

Thought:
  A: This option contradicts Fernbach's findings. He did find a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of a volunteer's position.
  B: The passage does not specifically state whether the understanding of an issue increased after analyzing it. However, it indicates that attempting to explain complex policies weakened extremists' illusions about being well-informed.
  C: The passage states that participants who merely listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
  D: This option is opposite to Fernbach's findings - the experiment showed that those with extreme views became more moderate after attempting to explain complex policies, which suggests they did not have the best understanding of the policies.

Criticism:
  My knowledge and thought process are consistent with the passage's information.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Fernbach's idea was that by explaining complex policies, it would force many to realize how little they know about the policies.
- After trying and failing to explain complex policies, the volunteers became more moderate in their views.
- When some volunteers listed reasons for liking a policy instead of explaining it, they remained extreme in their passion for their positions.

Thought:
- Choice A: A link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers' positions was found in the passage, so this would not be surprising for Fernbach.
- Choice B: Fernbach's intention was not to increase the understanding of a complicated political issue; it was to see if the explanation process could make people more moderate in their views.
- Choice C: The passage actually states that when volunteers just listed reasons, their views were generally unaffected. It was expected.
- Choice D: The passage implies the opposite, that when volunteers tried to explain complex issues, they realized their lack of understanding, which then affected the strength of their views.

Criticism:
- All the statements seem to be reviewed accurately.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Fernbach wanted to explore if people's deep-rooted convictions could be shaken by asking them to explain complex policies in detail.
- Fernbach's idea was that explaining the details of complex policies would force many people to realize how little they know about the policies and dampen their enthusiasm, thus taking less extreme positions.
- Two experiments were conducted in the study:
  1. Volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues.
  2. Some volunteers, instead of explaining a policy, simply listed reasons for liking it.
- Findings:
  1. Trying and failing to explain complex policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed, making them more moderate in their views.
  2. Those who simply listed reasons for their positions were less shaken in their views, continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and remained extreme in their passion for their positions.

Thought:
- The passage implies that Fernbach expected the following outcomes:
  1. Explaining complex policies in detail would make people realize how little they know about the policies and dampen their enthusiasm, thus taking less extreme positions.
  2. Volunteers who listed reasons for their positions would remain extreme in their passion for their positions.

- Therefore, Fernbach would have been most surprised by a finding that contradicts his expectations. 

Criticism:
- Let's compare the options with the expected outcomes and identify which finding would be the most surprising for Fernbach:

  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  - This would contradict Fernbach's expectation that explaining complex policies in detail would affect the strength of people's positions.
  
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  - Fernbach's main focus was on how explaining complex policies would affect people's positions, not necessarily their understanding.

  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  - This is in line with Fernbach's expectation that volunteers who listed reasons for their positions would remain extreme in their passion for their positions.

  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.
  - This would contradict Fernbach's expectation that explaining complex policies in detail would reveal people's lack of understanding, making them less extreme in their views.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- This passage discusses people's understanding of complex policies and the illusion of explanatory depth.
- Fernbach's lab experiments aimed to determine if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would make them confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
- The passage states that trying and failing to explain these complex policies undermines the extremists' illusions, and they become more moderate in their views as a result.
- People who just list reasons for their positions tend to remain extreme in their views.

Thoughts:
- Choice A discusses the link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of volunteers' positions. The passage does not explicitly talk about Fernbach's expectations on this matter.
- Choice B refers to the volunteers' understanding of a complicated political issue after analysis. Fernbach's experiment aimed to test if detailed explanations force them to confront their ignorance, but without specifying his surprise.
- Choice C states that when volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were unaffected by the exercise. The passage supports this idea, as it states that those who listed their reasons remained extreme in their views.
- Choice D talks about volunteers with the most extreme views having the best overall understanding of the complex issues. This outcome would be surprising to Fernbach because his experiments were designed to understand if a detailed explanation would make people confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands.

Criticism:
- The passage supports choice C, but it does not imply surprise on Fernbach's part about this outcome.
- Choice D, which suggests volunteers with extreme views having the best understanding of complex issues, would be the most surprising for Fernbach since it would clash with the aim of the lab experiments.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  A: No link was found between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the volunteers’ positions.
  B: After volunteers were asked to analyze a complicated political issue, their understanding of it did not increase.
  C: When volunteers were asked to list their reasons for endorsing a particular policy, their views were generally unaffected by the exercise.
  D: When volunteers were asked questions about complex issues, those with the most extreme views were found to have the best overall understanding of them.

Thought:
  The passage shows that Fernbach and his colleagues believed that analyzing complex issues in detail would make people realize their own ignorance and thus weaken their extremist views.
  
  A: It is not mentioned in the passage that Fernbach would be surprised by this finding, as the primary focus is on people confronting their ignorance and changing their positions.
  B: The passage suggests that Fernbach expected that understanding might not increase, but that confronting one’s own ignorance would lead to more moderate views.
  C: The passage mentions that people who only listed reasons for their positions remained firm in their views and continued thinking they understood the policies' complexity. Therefore, Fernbach would not be surprised by this result.
  D: Fernbach would be most surprised by this finding, as it goes against the main idea of the experiment, which was to show that being forced to analyze complex issues would reveal the lack of understanding and lead to less extreme positions.

Criticism: 
  There is no flaw in the above evaluation of the answer choices.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
  Fernbach's aim was to explore if forcing people to explain complex policies might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  A: Link between complexity and strength of positions - Passage talks about the illusion of understanding complex issues deep-rooted in people.
  B: Analyzing a complicated political issue, their understanding - Fernbach wanted to check how the explaining of complex policies affects views.
  C: Listing reasons for endorsing - Passage says that those who listed reasons for their positions continued to think they understood the policies and remained extreme in their views.
  D: Most extreme views with the best understanding - No direct evidence in the passage, but the goal was to see if articulating the details of a policy would weaken extremist positions.

Thought:
  The passage explains that Fernbach was curious about how explaining complex policies would affect people's views since there is often an illusion of understanding these issues.
  A: No direct mention of the link. However, the passage implies the strength of the positions could be changed upon understanding the details.
  B: This is the opposite of what Fernbach was trying to achieve. The objective was to see how explaining policies would affect their understanding and positions.
  C: The passage states that when volunteers listed their reasons, their views were mostly unaffected, which supports Fernbach's belief that deliberate analysis is required to make a change.
  D: The passage does not mention this, but the idea was to find a way to make people realize they aren't as knowledgeable as they thought and make them adjust their viewpoints.

Criticism:
  Fernbach would have likely been most surprised by a finding that contradicts the core of his hypothesis, which was forcing people to explain complex policies would weaken their extremist view.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Fernbach ran lab experiments to test if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail would make them confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
- The passage suggests that trying and failing to explain complex policies undermined the extremists' illusions about being well-informed, making them more moderate in their views.
- In a second experiment, some volunteers listed the reasons for liking a policy instead of explaining it. These participants continued to think they understood the policies and remained extreme in their passion for their positions.

Thought:
- A: The passage does not directly discuss whether there is a link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of volunteers' positions.
- B: The passage suggests that by trying and failing to explain complex policies, volunteers realized their limited understanding, which in turn moderated their views.
- C: This is supported by the passage, as participants who listed reasons for endorsing a particular policy remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
- D: The passage implies that extremists often have a false belief in their understanding of complex issues. Fernbach would be surprised if these people actually had the best overall understanding.

Criticism:
- A should be eliminated, as it does not address Fernbach's primary interest—whether explaining complex policies would weaken extremists' positions.
- B is invalidated by the passage, as it suggests that participants realized their limited understanding after attempting to analyze a complicated political issue.
- C aligns with the information in the passage but is unlikely to surprise Fernbach, as it supports his hypothesis that explaining complex policies—rather than simply listing reasons for supporting them—would have a greater effect on participants' positions.
- D is the most surprising finding for Fernbach, as it contradicts his hypothesis that extremists' beliefs are based on an illusion of explanatory depth.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses an experiment by Philip Fernbach that tested the effect of explaining complex policies in detail on participants' views.
- Fernbach's hypothesis: forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might confront them with their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands.
- After volunteers wrote detailed explanations of the policies, their views became more moderate.
- When volunteers listed reasons for their positions, they continued to think they understood the policies and remained extreme in their passion for their positions (not surprised by this result).

Thought:
- Given Fernbach's hypothesis, he would have expected the views of the volunteers to become more moderate when they were asked to analyze a complicated political issue.
- However, if they found no link between the complexity of an issue and the strength of the views or if those with the most extreme views had a better understanding of the issues, that would be surprising to Fernbach.

Criticism:
- The passage does not mention any evidence that supports the idea that Fernbach would be most surprised by a finding related to the complexity of an issue and the strength of views.
- However, the passage implies he would be surprised if the most extreme views had the best overall understanding of complex issues, since his hypothesis is that explaining the issues may weaken their extremist stands.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- Fernbach and his colleagues hypothesized that making people explain complex policies might weaken their extremist stands on issues.
- After the volunteers explained the complex policies, they realized their lack of knowledge and became more moderate in their views.
- When volunteers listed reasons for their positions, they continued to believe they understood the policies and remained extreme in their passion.

Thought:
A: The passage does not provide information to evaluate this statement.
B: The passage states that explaining the complex policies made the volunteers realize their own ignorance, which in turn moderated their views.
C: This statement aligns with the passage: volunteers who listed reasons for their positions remained extreme in their passion for their positions.
D: The passage states that trying to explain complex policies undermined extremists' illusions about being well-informed and made their views more moderate.

Criticism:
A: Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the complexity of an issue and extremists' lack of understanding were related, so it would surprise Fernbach if no link was found.
B: While it may seem surprising, this is not the most surprising finding because the passage emphasizes the moderating effect on views rather than the increase in understanding.
C: This finding is consistent with the passage, as it supports the observation that explaining complex policies moderated volunteers' views.
D: This finding would have been the most surprising for Fernbach because it contradicts his hypothesis that explaining complex policies would weaken extremists' stands on issues.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from the passagethat a megacity’s economic impact on a country is
Choices:
  A: greater in countries with larger physical land areas.
  B: dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity.
  C: relatively equal for developing countries and high-income countries.
  D: neutralized by the economic cost of maintaining a megacity.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- Megacities typically refer to cities with populations of over ten million people.
- Urbanization has historically been thought of as a necessary feature of economic development and growth.
- Researchers found that developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck from smaller and medium-size cities.
- Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries.
- Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to host knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.

Thought:
- Developing nations do not significantly benefit from larger cities, while advanced nations do.
- B: The economic impact may indeed be dependent on the types of companies located in the megacity since knowledge-based industries require urban agglomeration economies.
- A, C, and D do not have direct inferences outlined in the passage.

Criticism:
- There are no major flaws in my thought process.
- Option B aligns well with the information provided in the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  A megacity is typically defined as a city with a population of over 10 million people.
  The passage states that bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic impact in larger countries, and having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
  The passage also states that bigger, more developed countries are more likely to host knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies, and that the impact of urbanization on economic growth is not the same for developing and high-income countries.
    
Thought:
  A: The passage mentions that bigger cities tend to have a more positive impact in larger countries, but it does not state that this is specifically due to the physical land area of the country.
  B: The passage implies that the types of companies located in the megacity could influence the economic impact, as developed countries are more likely to host knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies. This suggests that the economic impact of a megacity might be dependent on the types of companies located there.
  C: The passage indicates that the impact of urbanization on economic growth is not the same for developing countries and high-income countries, with advanced nations benefitting more from larger cities compared to developing nations.
  D: The passage does not mention the economic cost of maintaining a megacity, so there is not enough information to infer that it neutralizes the economic impact.
  
Criticism:
  My analysis of the passage and the choices have been logical and consistent with the information provided.
  Based on the passage, it can be inferred that the economic impact of a megacity depends on the types of companies located in the megacity, as this is the aspect connected to urban agglomeration economies and the economic impact of urbanization on a nation.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  - Megacities are defined as cities with populations of over ten million people.
  - The passage discusses the different impacts of city sizes on a country's economy.

  - Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million or more.
  - Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play host to knowledge-based industries that require urban agglomeration economies.
  
Thought:
  - The passage implies that the economic impact of a megacity is not the same for every country. It depends on factors like the size of the country, the total urban population, and the types of industries present in the country.
  - The answer cannot be A, because it doesn't mention the size of the urban population or the types of industries that play a role in a megacity's economic impact.
  - The answer can be B because the passage mentions that bigger, more developed countries with knowledge-based industries benefit from urban agglomeration economies, which suggests that the types of companies located in the megacity play a role in its economic impact.
  - The answer cannot be C, because the passage states that the impact of megacities on developing countries and high-income countries is not the same.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

Question: An unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants
Choices:
  A: do not produce pyrethrums.
  B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
Response 0:
Relevant Information:
- Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants with anti-mite activity.
- The problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants.
- This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover.

Thought:
- Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source.
- The experimental group receives pyrethrum plants and clover, while the control group receives clover only.
- The authors assume something about the clover that it is not having the properties of pyrethrum-producing plants.

Choices Analysis:
  A: do not produce pyrethrums.
  This aligns with the thought that the clover does not have the properties that pyrethrum-producing plants have, meaning it does not produce pyrethrums.

  B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  This is not an assumption made by the authors. They make no mention of clover being part of the Chrysanthemum genus, and it is not relevant to the hypothesis.

  C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  This is not an assumption made by the authors in the text. The experiment is about honey bees being offered pyrethrum-producing plants and clover, not about the bees naturally encountering them.

  D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.
  Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source, so it is assumed by the authors that it is a good food source for honeybees in both experimental and control colonies.

Conclusion:
The unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that it does not produce pyrethrums. So the correct answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
- The passage states that the hypothesis can be tested by offering pyrethrum producing plants to a small number of honey bee colonies, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover.
- Pyrethrums are naturally occurring insecticides produced by some flowering plants, but the passage does not specifically mention if clover contains pyrethrums.
- Chrysanthemum genus includes plants under Pyrethrums group, but the passage does not provide information about clover being in this genus.
- Clover is considered as a typical food source for bee colonies in the passage.
- Control colonies are mentioned in the passage, but not specifically mentioned as not being good food sources for honey bees.

Thought:
- The hypothesis aims to test whether pyrethrum producing plants are beneficial to honey bee colonies. The use of clover as a control food source implies that it does not contain pyrethrums or play a significant role in limiting mite infection.
- Clover as a typical bee food source indicates that it sustains the bees but is not directly linked to assisting in fighting against mites, which is the focus of the hypothesis.

Criticism:
- The thought process is logical. The authors implicitly assume that clover does not produce pyrethrums as it is used as a control food source, separate from the pyrethrum producing plants.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  A: Clover does not produce pyrethrums. Pyrethrums are produced by plants of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  B: Clover is not a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: Wild-type honeybee colonies are not mentioned to have any specific relationship with clover.
  D: Clover is mentioned as a typical food source for bees in the passage. 

Thought:
  The authors use clover as a food source for the control colonies and pyrethrum-producing plants for the experimental colonies.
  The assumption about clover is that it doesn't produce pyrethrums, as that would negate the purpose of the control colonies.
  The answer should be A: do not produce pyrethrums.

Criticism:
  The reasoning is logical, and there are no flaws in the facts, logic, or reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Relevant knowledge:
  - Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source.
  - Pyrethrum-producing plants are separate from clover in the context of the experimental setup.
  - The experiment seeks to test the effects of pyrethrum-producing plants on mite infestations in honeybee colonies.
  - The text suggests that bees in commercial colonies are nutritionally deficient and may lack anti-mite toxins such as pyrethrums.

Step-by-step analysis:
  - The unstated assumption about clover should relate to the experimental design and the context of the passage.
  - Since clover is separate from pyrethrum-producing plants, it could be assumed that clover may not contain pyrethrums.
  - The passage does not suggest that clover is part of the Chrysanthemum genus, nor does it directly relate to the location of wild-type honeybee colonies.
  - The passage does consider clover as a typical food source for bees, so it is not expected to be a poor food source for honeybees in the control colonies.

Critical evaluation:
  - The assumption that clover does not produce pyrethrums directly relates to the experimental design, providing a clear distinction between the test group (with pyrethrum-producing plants) and the control group (with only clover).
  - Options B, C, and D do not seem to be relevant to the authors' argument or experimental design.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the possible impact of pyrethrums on honeybees and their ability to defend against mites.
  Clover is mentioned in the passage as a typical bee food source.
  Pyrethrums are naturally occurring insecticides produced by certain Chrysanthemum species.
  The passage proposes testing honeybees with a food source containing pyrethrum-producing plants as well as typical food sources like clover.

Thought:
  A: The passage suggests that clover is a typical food source for bees and does not mention that it contains pyrethrums.
  B: The passage does not mention that clover belongs to the Chrysanthemum genus; it only mentions Chrysanthemum as a pyrethrum-producing plant.
  C: The passage does not explicitly mention the location of clover plants near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: The passage indicates that clover is a typical food source for bees but does not discuss the nutritional quality or deficiencies related to clover itself.

Criticism:
  Answer A: This assumption seems valid since the passage does not state or suggest that clover contains pyrethrums. The experimental design aims to provide both pyrethrum-producing plants and clover, indicating clover is not a source of pyrethrums.
  Answer B: There is no information in the passage about clover being a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  Answer C: The passage does not provide information on the location of clover plants concerning wild-type honeybee colonies.
  Answer D: Clover is described as a typical food source for bees in the passage, which implies it is a good food source. Thus, this assumption is not valid.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
- Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants that include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species.
- These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity.
- In the experiment, honey bee colonies are offered pyrethrum-producing plants and a typical bee food source such as clover.

Thought:
- The assumption is related to clover plants.
- The experimental colonies are given pyrethrum-producing plants as well as clover.
- The control colonies in the experiment are given only clover.

Criticism:
- The assumption must be about clover plants that explain their use in the experiment.

Analyze the choices:
  A: do not produce pyrethrums: Clover plants are not part of the Chrysanthemum genus, which contains pyrethrum-producing plants. This can be the correct assumption since clover is given to the control colonies, which might not have the anti-mite effect of pyrethrums.
  B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus: This contradicts what we know about pyrethrum-producing plants and the Chrysanthemum genus.
  C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies: This choice is unrelated to the main hypothesis of the passage and does not explain the use of clover in the experiment.
  D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies: This assumption would not make sense in the context of the experiment, as researchers would not want to provide a bad food source for the control colonies, which might skew the results.

The best answer is the one that fits the context of the experiment involving pyrethrum-producing plants and clover plants for honeybee colonies.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the hypothesis that feeding on pyrethrum-producing plants might help bees fight mite infestation.
  Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source in the test design (line 45).
  The passage does not explicitly state any information about clover's production of pyrethrums, its relationship to Chrysanthemum, or its location relative to wild-type honeybee colonies.

Thought:
  The authors suggest using clover as a food source for control colonies in the experiment (line 45). 
  They postulate that the problem lies in a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins like pyrethrums.
  For this hypothesis to make sense within the context of the experiment, clover should not produce pyrethrums; otherwise, it would interfere with what the authors are testing.

Criticism:
  The thought process is logical, and we have no contradictory information.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
Clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source in the passage.
Pyrethrum-producing plants are discussed separately from clover.
The hypothesis test mentioned in the passage involves offering commercial honey bee colonies a combination of pyrethrum-producing plants and clover.

Options:
A: Clover not producing pyrethrums would mean it is separate from the pyrethrum-producing plants mentioned in the passage. This distinction holds importance in the hypothesis test where both are provided.
B: The Chrysanthemum genus consists of plants that produce pyrethrums. Clover is not mentioned as part of this genus.
C: The passage does not discuss the location of wild-type honeybee colonies, nor does it mention their relation to clover.
D: The passage mentions offering clover to control colonies; if it were not a good food source, it would not be offered as part of the control colonies' food source.

Thought:
Given the knowledge and options, option A seems the most plausible. The passage focuses on pyrethrum-producing plants and how they might aid in strengthening honeybees against mite infestation. Clover is provided as a typical bee food source to both experimental colonies and control colonies in the hypothesis test. The assumption that clover does not produce pyrethrums is implied due to the clear distinction between the two and the test involving both.

Criticism:
None. The reasoning and the selection are sound.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
  The passage mentions that the experiment will involve offering honey bee colonies a choice between pyrethrum-producing plants and clover, which is a typical bee food source.
  A: If clover produces pyrethrums, the experiment wouldn't effectively test the hypothesis.
  B: The passage does not mention the Chrysanthemum genus in relation to clover.
  C: The passage does not discuss the location of clover near wild-type honeybee colonies.
  D: The passage identifies clover as a typical bee food source, suggesting it would be a suitable food source for the control colonies.

Thought:
  The passage implies that clover and pyrethrum-producing plants are different, and the test will involve offering bees a choice between the two. If clover also produces pyrethrums, it would not effectively test the hypothesis. 

Criticism:
  The authors' assumption about clover is that it does not produce pyrethrums, thereby effectively testing their hypothesis.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Clover is mentioned as a "typical bee food source" in the passage.
  Clover is not mentioned as producing pyrethrums or being a member of the Chrysanthemum genus.
  Wild-type honeybee colonies are also mentioned, but there is no specific reference to their proximity to clover plants.
  The authors suggest using clover as a food source for the control colonies in the experiment, meaning it should be a sufficient food source for honeybees.

Thought:
  A: Since clover is mentioned as a typical bee food source but not specifically mentioned as a pyrethrum-producing plant, it can be inferred that it does not produce pyrethrums.
  B: It is not indicated that clover is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus anywhere in the passage.
  C: There is no specific mention of clover being located near wild-type honeybee colonies in the passage.
  D: The authors suggest using clover as a food source for honeybees in the control colonies, which implies that it is a suitable food source for those bees.

Criticism:
  Considering the available information in the passage, there is no reason to doubt those conclusions.

Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Question: done") The narrator indicates that he pays Sempere

Relevant information from the text: 
  "The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left."

Thought:
  The narrator mentions that Sempere hardly ever allowed him to pay for the books, but he would leave coins on the counter when Sempere wasn't looking.

Choice evaluation:
  A: less than Sempere expects him to pay for the books - The text doesn't mention any expected payment amount from Sempere.
  B: nothing, because Sempere won't take his money - This is partially correct, Sempere doesn't allow him to pay but the narrator still leaves the coins.
  C: the money he makes selling sweets to the other children - The text doesn't mention the narrator selling sweets to other children.
  D: much less for the books than they are worth - While the text doesn't provide the exact value of the books, it is suggested that the coins left by the narrator may not be enough to actually buy the books (he compares the amount to buying a booklet of cigarette papers).

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

D: Respect but not utter deference - Akira's approach, tone, and language in the passage indicate that he is respectful towards Chie. However, his direct approach and skipping the traditional customs show that he is not showing complete deference to Chie.

Thought:

Given the passage's information, it seems that Akira addresses Chie with respect but not utter deference.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
A: Affection but not genuine love implies that Akira is showing care and fondness but doesn't convey a deep or romantic love for Chie.

C: Amusement but not mocking disparagement implies that Akira is entertained or finds the situation somewhat funny, but doesn't mock or belittle Chie.
D: Respect but not utter deference implies that Akira is showing politeness and esteem towards Chie, but not total submission, humbleness, or obedience.

Thought:
In the passage, Akira speaks to Chie in a formal and polite manner. He seeks her approval for marrying her daughter, but he is also assertive about his intentions and feelings. He is careful to address her respectfully, bowing and apologizing when necessary.

Criticism:
My thoughts appear to be accurate based on the given passage - Akira addresses Chie with respect, politeness, and esteem while stating his intentions for marriage and the proposed plan of moving to America. He doesn't show affection or love towards her, nor is his tone overly objective or impartial, and he doesn't seem amused or mocking.

It is interesting to note that when Akira speaks to Chie, his voice is respectful, serious, and measured. Let's analyze each of the choices based on these observations.

A: affection but not genuine love
  Akira is not addressing Chie with affectionate and loving words; he is direct and business-like in his approach.

B: objectivity but not complete impartiality
  Akira maintains a polite tone and does not appear biased or partial, but he is also there with a personal agenda.

C: amusement but not mocking disparagement
  Akira's attitude in the passage is not amusing or mocking whatsoever, and there is no evidence of disparagement either.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the  countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between 5 the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: It is well known that some animal species use.camouflage to hide from predators. Individuals that.are able to blend in to their surroundings and avoid.being eaten are able to survive longer, reproduce, and.thus increase their fitness (pass along their genes to.the next generation) compared to those who stand.out more. This may seem like a good strategy, and.fairly common in the animal kingdom, but who ever.heard of a plant doing the same thing?.In plants, the use of coloration or pigmentation as.a vital component of acquiring food (e.g.,.photosynthesis) or as a means of attracting.pollinators (e.g., flowers) has been well studied..However, variation in pigmentation as a means of.escaping predation has received little attention..Matthew Klooster from Harvard University and.colleagues empirically investigated whether the dried.bracts (specialized leaves) on a rare woodland plant,.Monotropsis odorata, might serve a similar purpose.as the stripes on a tiger or the grey coloration of the.wings of the peppered moth: namely, to hide..“Monotropsis odoratais a fascinating plant.species, as it relies exclusively upon mycorrhizal.fungus, that associates with its roots, for all of the.resources it needs to live,” notes Klooster. “Because.this plant no longer requires photosynthetic.pigmentation (i.e., green coloration) to produce its.own energy, it is free to adopt a broader range of.possibilities in coloration, much like fungi or.animals.”.Using a large population ofMonotropsis odorata,.Klooster and colleagues experimentally removed the.dried bracts that cover the 3- to 5-cm tall stems and.flower buds of these woodland plants. The bracts are.a brown color that resembles the leaf litter from.which the reproductive stems emerge and cover the.pinkish-purple colored buds and deep purple stems..When Klooster and colleagues measured the.reflectance pattern (the percentage of light reflected.at various wavelengths) of the different plant parts,.they indeed found that the bracts functioned as.camouflage, making the plant blend in with its.surroundings; the bract reflectance pattern closely.resembled that of the leaf litter, and both differed.from that of the reproductive stem and flowers.hidden underneath the bracts. Furthermore, they.experimentally demonstrated that this camouflage.actually worked to hide the plant from its predators.and increased its fitness. Individuals with intact.bracts suffered only a quarter of the herbivore.damage and produced a higher percentage of mature.fruits compared to those whose bracts were removed..“It has long been shown that animals use cryptic.coloration (camouflage) as a defense mechanism to.visually match a component of their natural.environment, which facilitates predator avoidance,”.Klooster said. “We have now experimentally.demonstrated that plants have evolved a similar.strategy to avoid their herbivores.”.Drying its bracts early to hide its reproductive.parts is a good strategy when the stems are exposed.to predators for long periods of time: all the other.species in the subfamily Monotropoideae have.colorful fleshy bracts and are reproductively active.for only a quarter of the length of time. Somewhat.paradoxically, however,Monotropsis odorataactually.relies on animals for pollination and seed dispersal..How does it accomplish this when it is disguised as.dead leaf material and is able to hide so well? The.authors hypothesize that the flowers emit highly.fragrant odors that serve to attract pollinators and.seed dispersal agents; indeed they observed bumble.bees finding and pollinating many reproductive.stems that were entirely hidden by the leaf litter itself.
Question: The passage indicates that compared with other functions of coloration in plants, camouflage in plants has
Choices:
  A: provided scientists with a deeper understanding of potential food sources.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.Let every American, every lover of liberty, every.well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the.Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,.the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their.violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did.to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so.to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every.American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred.honor;—let every man remember that to violate the.law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to.tear the character of his own, and his children’s.liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by.every American mother, to the lisping babe, that.prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in.seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in.Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be.preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative.halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,.let it become thepolitical religionof the nation;.and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,.the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and.colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its.altars.....When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of.all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there.are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,.for the redress of which, no legal provisions have.been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do.mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,.should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they.continue in force, for the sake of example, they.should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided.cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be.made for them with the least possible delay; but, till.then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with..There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress.by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,.the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two.positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right.within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of.all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and.therefore proper to be prohibited by legal.enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition.of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable..Passage 2.Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey.them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey.them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress.them at once? Men generally, under such a.government as this, think that they ought to wait.until they have persuaded the majority to alter them..They think that, if they should resist, the remedy.would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the.government itself that the remedy is worse than the.evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to.anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not.cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist.before it is hurt?....If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of.the machine of government, let it go, let it go;.perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the.machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or.a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,.then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy.will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a.nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice.to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be.a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have.to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to.the wrong which I condemn..As for adopting the ways which the State has.provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such.ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will.be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into.this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to.live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has.not everything to do, but something; and because he.cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he.should do something wrong.....I do not hesitate to say, that those who call.themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually.withdraw their support, both in person and property,.from the government...andnotwait till they.constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the.right to prevail through them. I think that it is.enough if they have God on their side, without.waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more.right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one.already.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.At the 2007 American Geophysical Union’s.meeting in Acapulco, Mexico, some two dozen.scientists presented multiple studies arguing that a.comet or asteroid exploded above or on the northern.ice cap almost 13,000 years ago—showering debris.across the North American continent and causing.temperatures to plunge for the next millennium..The team argues that its idea explains multiple.observations: not only the climate cooling and the.disappearance of the Clovis hunters, but also the.near-simultaneous extinction of the continent’s large.mammals..Not all will be convinced. Several leading.hypotheses already explain each of these three events..A change in ocean circulation is generally thought to.have brought about the onset of the millennium-long.cooling, which is known as the Younger Dryas. This.cooling might, in turn, have caused the Clovis.hunters to disappear. And, if they had not previously.been killed by disease or hunted to extinction, the big.prehistoric beasts may also have been doomed by this.change in climate..The new evidence comes in the form of.geochemical analysis of sedimentary layers at 25.archaeological sites across North America—9 of.them Clovis. Certain features of the layers, say the.team, suggest that they contain debris formed by an.extraterrestrial impact. These include spherules of.glass and carbon, and amounts of the element.iridium said to be too high to have originated on.Earth. In addition, the rocks contain black layers of.carbonized material, which the team says are the.remains of wildfires that swept across the continent.after the impact..Passage 2.Proponents of the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis have claimed various kinds of evidence.for the hypothesis, including deposits of the element.iridium (rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites),.microscopic diamonds (called nanodiamonds), and.magnetic particles in deposits at sites supposedly.dated to about 12,800 years ago. These claims were.sharply contested by some specialists in the relevant.fields, however, who either did not detect such.evidence or argued that the deposits had other causes.than a cosmic impact. For example, some say that.nanodiamonds are common in ordinary geological.formations, and that magnetic particles could come.from ordinary fires..Now comes what some researchers consider the.strongest attack yet on the Younger Dryas impact.hypothesis. In a paper published recently in the.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,a.team led by David Meltzer, an archaeologist at.Southern Methodist University, Dallas, in Texas,.looks at the dating of 29 different sites in the.Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which.impact advocates have reported evidence for a.cosmic collision. They include sites in which.sophisticated stone projectiles called Clovis points,.used by some of the earliest Americans to hunt.mammals beginning about 13,000 years ago, have.been found. The team argues that when the quality.and accuracy of the dating—which was based on.radiocarbon and other techniques—is examined.closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within.the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier.or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of.years..“The supposed Younger Dryas impact fails on.both theoretical and empirical grounds,” says.Meltzer, who adds that the popular appeal of the.hypothesis is probably due to the way that it provides.“simple explanations for complex problems.” Thus,.“giant chunks of space debris clobbering the planet.and wiping out life on Earth has undeniably broad.appeal,” Meltzer says, whereas “no one in Hollywood.makes movies” about more nuanced explanations,.such as Clovis points disappearing because early.Americans turned to other forms of stone tool.technology as the large mammals they were hunting.went extinct as a result of the changing climate or.hunting pressure..But impact proponents appear unmoved by the.new study. “We still stand fully behind the [impact.hypothesis], which is based on more than a.confluence of dates,” says Richard Firestone, a.nuclear chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National.Laboratory in California. “Radiocarbon dating is a.perilous process,” he contends, adding that the.presence of Clovis artifacts and mammoth bones just.under the claimed iridium, nanodiamond, and.magnetic sphere deposits is a more reliable indicator.that an extraterrestrial event was responsible for their.disappearance.
Question: Based on Passage 2, Meltzer and his team relied on what evidence to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis?
Choices:
  A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact
  B: The discovery of additional Clovis artifacts in a host of sites besides the 29 initially identified
  C: Analyses showing that nanodiamonds can occur in geologic formations lacking indications of extraterrestrial impacts
  D: High concentrations of iridium that have been found in sedimentary layers beneath the proposed impact layer
Response 0:
Passage 2 mentions that Meltzer's team evaluated the dating of 29 different sites, which were used as evidence supporting the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. After closely examining the quality and accuracy of the dating, they argued that only three of these sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset. This suggests that they relied on a reevaluation of dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact to challenge the hypothesis.

Thought:
- Meltzer's team reevaluated the dates assigned to the sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
- The focus was on the accuracy of the dating of these sites in relation to the Younger Dryas onset.
- Therefore, the evidence they relied on to challenge the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is a reevaluation of the dates assigned to the sites.

Criticism:
- The passage supports the thought process, and the conclusion is consistent with the information provided.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

Topic: English
Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

Topic: English
Context: Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the.North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had.got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air,.his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. Few.fellows had talents like his and fewer still could.remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher’s heart.was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It.was something to have a friend like that..Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time.had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s.invitation and of the great city of London where.Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because,.though he was but slightly under the average stature,.he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands.were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice.was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the.greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and.used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The.half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he.smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish.white teeth..As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought.what changes those eight years had brought. The.friend whom he had known under a shabby and.necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the.London Press. He turned often from his tiresome.writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of.a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and.walks. It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the.untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on.the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures.—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel.paths and on everyone who passed through the.gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life;.and (as always happened when he thought of life) he.became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of.him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against.fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the.ages had bequeathed to him..He remembered the books of poetry upon his.shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor.days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room.off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down.from the bookshelf and read out something to his.wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so.the books had remained on their shelves. At times he.repeated lines to himself and this consoled him..When his hour had struck he stood up and took.leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks.punctiliously. He emerged from under the feudal.arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and.walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden.sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A.horde of grimy children populated the street. They.stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps.before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon.the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no thought..He picked his way deftly through all that minute life.and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions.in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered..No memory of the past touched him, for his mind.was full of a present joy..He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the.value of the name. He knew that people went there.after the theatre to eat oysters; and he had heard that.the waiters there spoke French and German..Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn.up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted.by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore.noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were.powdered and they caught up their dresses, when.they touched earth. He had always passed without.turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk.swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he.found himself in the city late at night he hurried on.his way apprehensively and excitedly. Sometimes,.however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose.the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked.boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his.footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures.troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive.laughter made him tremble like a leaf..He turned to the right towards Capel Street..Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would.have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now.that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could.remember many signs of future greatness in his.friend.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?
Choices:
  A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
  B: Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.
  C: Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.
  D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 is written by Alexis de Tocqueville, which discusses the democratic equality between men and women. Tocqueville emphasizes the natural differences between men and women and suggests their distinct roles in society.
  Passage 2 is written by John Stuart Mill, which discusses the concept of equal rights and the transition from a society based on inequality to a more equal society. Mill argues for the freedom of choice in occupations for men and women based on their abilities.

Thought:
Comparing the two passages, Tocqueville believes that men and women have different roles based on their natural differences, while Mill advocates for equality between the sexes and believes abilities should be the determining factor for an individual's position in society. 

Criticism:
The comparison and understanding of the two passages are accurate. 

Action: Answer("A")
Choice A best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society. Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 is written by Alexis de Tocqueville.
  Passage 2 is written by John Stuart Mill.

  Tocqueville describes the importance of maintaining distinct roles for men and women in a society based on their natural differences and abilities.

  Mill argues that individuals should be free to pursue the occupations they find most suitable and that society will benefit from the best faculties of all its inhabitants if they're allowed to choose their positions freely, regardless of their sex or class.

Thoughts:
  A: The comparison seems accurate. Tocqueville defines the roles of individuals based on their sex, while Mill believes in maximizing individual potential through freedom of choice.
  B: Economic class is not the primary focus of either author in these passages. This doesn't accurately describe their views on an individual's position in society.
  C: Temperament is not addressed by either author, so this choice doesn't represent their positions.
  D: Tocqueville does stress the importance of dividing roles by sex for a better-functioning society, but his argument is based on natural differences. Mill does not argue that individual positions should be solely determined by what they find most rewarding.

Criticism:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

He believes that society would benefit from the best abilities of all its inhabitants, regardless of sex or class.

Thought:
  A: This choice accurately reflects Tocqueville's view of the individual's position being defined by sex, and Mill's view that abilities should be the determining factor.
  B: The passages do not discuss Tocqueville's view on economic class as a determining factor for an individual's position.
  C: The texts do not discuss Tocqueville's view on an individual's temperament as a determining factor for an individual's position, nor Mill's view on temperament being irrelevant.

  - This choice is not accurate because neither passage focuses on the temperament of individuals.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:

He argues that American society divides the duties of men and women to optimize the societal structure.

  Passage 2, written by Mill, focuses on the importance of individual choice in determining one's abilities and the importance of allowing people to choose their roles in society without limitations based on sex or class. Mill suggests that individuals should have the chance to prove their capabilities and that society will then distribute roles most efficiently.

Thought:
  Choice A: This choice aligns with each author's main viewpoint as expressed in the passages. Tocqueville emphasizes distinct roles based on sex, while Mill argues that individual abilities should determine a person's position in society.

  Choice D: While Tocqueville focuses on what is most beneficial to society in terms of dividing roles between men and women, Mill does not argue that personal satisfaction should be the sole determinant of an individual's position. He believes in allowing individuals to choose and prove their abilities. This choice doesn't fully capture Mill's point of view.

Thought:
  A: Tocqueville acknowledges the differences between the sexes but implies that their position within society should be determined by their capabilities; Mill believes the individual's abilities should define their position in society.
  B: Tocqueville does not specifically focus on economic class in his passage, so option B does not adequately summarize his view.
  C: Tocqueville does not mention temperament as a factor in the individual's position, so option C does not accurately reflect his view.
  D: Tocqueville does suggest that society should efficiently use each gender's talents, but he also acknowledges inherent differences between the sexes; Mill's argument is more focused on individual choice.

  C: Tocqueville does not mention temperament as a factor, making this choice also inaccurate.

Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open

Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Scientists believe that iron meteorites come from.the cores of asteroids that melted. But what happened.to the corresponding rocky material that formed the.mantles of these bodies? A few asteroids have spectra^1.that match those of mantle rocks, but they are very.rare. Some nonmetallic meteorites come from.asteroids that have partially or wholly melted, but.these do not match the minerals we would expect to.see in the missing mantles of the iron parent bodies..These exotic meteorites must come from some other.kind of parent body instead..The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite.collection and in the asteroid belt, known as the.“missing mantle problem,” is a long-standing puzzle..There are several reasons why iron fragments might.survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids.break apart. Iron lies in the core of a differentiated.asteroid, while rocky material lies near the surface..Thus, rocky material will be the first to be removed.when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last.to be exposed. As a result, rocky fragments have to.survive in space for longer than iron ones. Most of the.rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments.—chips from the surface—while the iron core remains.as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Last.and most important, iron is much stronger than rock:.a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at.least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the.same size..If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in.the solar system, perhaps all the mantle material has.been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of.years since then. This would mean that intact.differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid.belt today. Perhaps Vesta [a differentiated asteroid.with a diameter of more than 300 miles] and a handful.of others are all that remain..However, collisional erosion cannot be the whole.story. Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of.chondritic meteorites [the most common type of.meteorite found on Earth], are no stronger than the.mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. How did.so many primitive asteroids survive when almost.none of the differentiated ones did? Part of the.explanation may simply be that differentiated bodies.were relatively rare to begin with and none have.survived. Still, if almost all differentiated bodies were.destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive.with only a single large crater on its surface?.Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues.recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps.the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer.to the Sun, in the region that now contains the.terrestrial planets. Objects would have been more.tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would.have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt..Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were.disrupted by violent collisions. Gravitational.perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of.these fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and.rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only.the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of.the solar system. Later on, the parent bodies of.primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt. Most.of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt.today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and.fragments of iron..(^1) Characteristic wavelengths of light that asteroids reflect
Question: According to the passage, Bottke and his colleaguesexplain the presence of iron fragments in theasteroid belt by asserting that the fragments were
Choices:
  A: remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in collisions in the asteroid belt.
  B: created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.
  C: formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids.
  D: formed in the region of the terrestrial planets but knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
- Bottke and his colleagues suggest a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
- Differentiated asteroids are those that have distinct layers, with iron in the core and rocky materials on the surface.
- They suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, where collisions happened more frequently.

Thought:
- The passage states that Bottke and his colleagues' possible explanation is that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun.
- From there, in the region that contains the terrestrial planets, collisions occurred more frequently.
- Gravitational interference from larger bodies scattered fragments of both iron and rocky materials into the asteroid belt.
- As a result, the stronger iron objects have survived in the asteroid belt for the age of the solar system.

Criticism:
- The explanation provided by Bottke aligns closest with option B as it describes the creation of the iron fragments relatively close to the Sun, with the gravitational influence of larger bodies causing them to end up in the asteroid belt.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" and the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt. Bottke and his colleagues have provided a possible explanation for this phenomenon.

Recall: 
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that contains the terrestrial planets. Objects in this area had a higher probability of colliding as they were more tightly packed. Many differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions in this region. Both iron and rocky fragments were scattered into the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger celestial bodies. However, only the stronger iron objects survived for the age of the solar system.

Thought: 
  The explanation offered by Bottke and his colleagues states that iron fragments were created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.

Answer: 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The text states that Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the fragments were created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.

Thought:
  The text states that Bottke and his colleagues' explanation involves the formation of iron meteorite parent bodies near the Sun and that gravitational perturbations from larger bodies caused the fragments to scatter into the asteroid belt.

Criticism:
  There is no flaw in the thought process, as it matches the information provided in the passage.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
Bottke and his colleagues are mentioned in the passage as having come up with a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.

Thoughts:
The passage states that Bottke and his colleagues proposed that the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets. Tightly packed objects would have had more collisions, possibly disrupting differentiated bodies. Gravitational disturbances from larger bodies scattered some fragments into the asteroid belt. Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt but only the stronger iron objects managed to survive for the age of the solar system. Later, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed at the asteroid belt.

Criticism:
The passage provides ample context and support for the explanation provided by Bottke and his colleagues. Choice D reflects the explanation most accurately.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the "missing mantle problem" regarding meteorites and provides an explanation by William Bottke and his colleagues for iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  A: The passage explains that differentiated asteroids may have broken apart early in the solar system.
  B: Bottke and his colleagues suggest that parent bodies of iron meteorites may have formed closer to the Sun and that their fragments were scattered into the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger bodies.
  C: The passage does not mention iron fragments being formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt due to collisions with primitive asteroids.
  D: The passage states that Bottke and his colleagues propose that many differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions near the Sun and that their fragments were later scattered into the asteroid belt.

Thought:
  According to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues suggest that parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun and their iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt due to gravitational perturbations from larger bodies. Only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.

Criticism:
  The logic and reasoning used to reach the conclusion are sound, and the analysis of the passage is accurate.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The passage explains the "missing mantle problem" and discusses possible reasons for the abundance of iron meteorites in the asteroid belt.
  - Bottke and his colleagues propose a possible explanation for the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt.
  - Gravitational perturbations are mentioned as a factor for why fragments arrived in the asteroid belt.
  - Iron fragments are more resilient and more likely to survive than rocky fragments.
  
Thought:
A: Option A suggests that the iron fragments are remnants of differentiated asteroids that were destroyed in the asteroid belt. However, the passage states that Bottke and his colleagues believe the parent bodies of iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, not directly in the asteroid belt.
 
B: Option B states that the iron fragments were created relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects. This aligns with the fact that Bottke and his colleagues' explanation mentioned the parent bodies of iron meteorites forming closer to the Sun and gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattering them.

C: Option C suggests that the iron fragments were formed on terrestrial planets and ejected into the asteroid belt by collisions with primitive asteroids. The passage does not mention terrestrial planets as the origin of the iron meteorites; rather, it suggests the region where terrestrial planets are located.

D: Option D: suggests that the iron fragments were formed in the region of the terrestrial planets but knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions with the parent bodies of primitive asteroids. This option aligns with Bottke and his colleagues’ theory about the origin of iron fragments.

Criticism: 
  - Option A does not reflect the complete hypothesis presented by Bottke and his colleagues regarding the origins of iron fragments.
  - Option B accurately represents Bottke and his colleagues' theory, but it doesn't mention the involvement of collisions which ultimately led the fragments to the asteroid belt.
  - Option C incorrectly attributes the formation of iron fragments to terrestrial planets rather than the region they are found in.
  - Option D best reflects Bottke and his colleagues' theory, as it includes both the idea that the iron fragments formed in the region of terrestrial planets and that they were knocked into the asteroid belt by collisions.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again

Conclusion:
Both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relation to the expansion of the Union. Therefore, the appropriate answer is A: the expansion of the Union.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Relevant knowledge: 
  Passage 1 talks about the division of Free and Slave States, the growth and expansion of the nation, the right of each State to regulate its own affairs, and the idea that the Union can continue to expand if it operates on the principle of State rights and State sovereignty. Slavery is mentioned in the context of the division between Free and Slave States and the Union's expansion.
  
  Passage 2 speaks about the division mentioned in the quote "a house divided against itself cannot stand," acknowledging the variety in institutions and laws amongst states due to differences in soil, climate, and other natural features. It then mentions that disputes and conflicts have arisen due to the issue of slavery, which is a different factor than the aforementioned differences. The expansion of slavery into new territories is also mentioned as a potential source of conflict.

Thought process:
  A: the expansion of the Union - Considering both passages discuss the growth and expansion of the nation and its relation to the issue of slavery, this choice seems relevant.
  B: questions of morality - While there are mentions of right and wrong, both passages talk mostly about statehood and the expansion of the Union due to the issue of slavery, so this choice is less relevant.
  C: religious toleration - Neither of the passages prominently discusses religious toleration. This choice is not relevant.
  D: laws regulating commerce - Passage 2 briefly mentions laws regulating commerce as not a significant source of disputes or divisions between states, but it is not the main focus of either passage. This choice is less relevant.

Criticism: 
  The thought process seems logical, and relevant information has been analyzed to determine the best answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Relevant Knowledge:
Passage 1 discusses the division of Free and Slave states in the context of the strength and expansion of the United States. It argues that the Union can exist forever as such if each State respects the right of the others to do as they please, allowing for future expansion and growth.

Passage 2 addresses the points made in Mr. Lincoln's speech, which includes the statement that "a house divided against itself cannot stand." The passage agrees with the variety of institutions in different states but emphasizes that the issue of slavery has caused quarrels and difficulties, unlike other regulations such as commerce.

A: The expansion of the Union - Both passages mention the growth, expansion, and need for acquiring new territories in relation to the slavery issue.
B: Questions of morality - While morality might be indirectly mentioned or argued in the context of slavery, it is not the primary focus of the passages.
C: Religious toleration - Neither of the passages discusses religious toleration in relation to slavery.
D: Laws regulating commerce - The laws regulating commerce are mentioned in Passage 2, but only in comparison to the issue of slavery. The focus remains on the slavery issue.

Thought:
- Both Passage 1 and Passage 2 address slavery in relation to the Union.
- Passage 1 focuses on the division of Free and Slave states and the ability to maintain the Union if this division is accepted.
- Passage 2 counters what Mr. Lincoln said about the divided house and discusses the quarrels caused by the slavery issue in comparison to other regulatory matters like commerce.
- Therefore, choice A is the option that best describes slavery in relation to the expansion of the Union.

Criticism:
- The facts and logic within the thought process are correct.
- Comparing the choices and the content of the passages indicates that choice A is the most accurate option.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What does the author imply about pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation?
Choices:
  A: They communicate with each other in the same way as do ibises.
  B: They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
  D: They expend more energy than do ibises.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  - The study focused on ibises and their V formation flight behavior.
  - The findings suggest that birds carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping to save energy during flight.
  - Line 44-46: The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says.
  - Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult.

Thought:
  - The author implies that other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, might exhibit similar flight behaviors as ibises in a V formation.
  - These behaviors include positioning their wingtips, syncing their flapping, and saving energy during flight.
  - So, the most likely implication is that they create a similar wake to that of ibises.

Criticism:
  - The facts and logic seem consistent.
  - The implication about pelicans, storks, and geese is correctly deduced from the information provided and the author's statement in the text.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The study focuses on the flying patterns of ibises.
  A new study finds that big-winged birds like ibises carefully position their wingtips and sync their flapping to catch the preceding bird's updraft and save energy during flight.
  The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese.
  They do not specifically mention that pelicans, storks, and geese communicate in the same way as ibises, have the same migration routes as those of ibises, or expend more energy than do ibises.

Thought:
  The study discovered the positioning and flapping synchronization of ibises during flight, which saves energy.
  The author implies that the findings likely apply to pelicans, storks, and geese as well - that they may use the same flying method to save energy during flight, similar to ibises.
  This means the author implies of the options given that C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.

Criticism:
  The thoughts align with the relevant information from the passage and the answer choices.
  The author implies that other long-winged birds like pelicans, storks, and geese, might use similar flying methods as the ibises, creating similar wakes and saving energy during flight.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  According to the passage, the findings from the study on ibises likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. This implies that there is some similarity among these species regarding their flight or energy-saving mechanisms when flying in a V formation.

Options:
  A: The text does not specifically mention communication among these bird species.
  B: Migration routes are not discussed in the context of pelicans, storks, and geese.
  C: The passage mentions that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, which suggests that these birds might create a similar wake to that of ibises, facilitating energy-saving while flying in a V formation.
  D: The text does not mention that these birds expend more energy than ibises.

Thought:
  The passage indicates that the findings on ibises' V formation behavior could apply to other long-winged birds such as pelicans, storks, and geese, implying similarities in their flight or energy-saving mechanisms, possibly including the wake created during flight. This leads to option C as the most suitable answer.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: Based on the passages, both authors would agree with which of the following claims?
Choices:
  A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
  B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
  C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
  D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 is written by Catharine Beecher, arguing that women hold a subordinate role in society and should influence their surroundings through peace, love, and the refinement of their intellectual and emotional abilities. She believes that women should focus on their domestic and social responsibilities rather than engage in political activism.
  Passage 2 is written by Angelina Grimké in response to Beecher, arguing that human rights, regardless of sex, are based on individuals' moral nature. Grimké suggests that whatever is morally right for men to do, it is also morally right for women to do, regardless of societal expectations.

Thoughts:
  Let's examine each claim in light of the passages:
  A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
    - Both authors seem to recognize the moral responsibilities that women have in society, although they might disagree on the scope and nature of those responsibilities.
  B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
    - Neither passage directly addresses this claim or makes generalizations about men working selflessly for political change.
  C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
    - Beecher acknowledges that women's duties and influence are important, but still stands by the idea that they should remain within a certain sphere. Grimké, on the other hand, argues for a more equal recognition of rights and responsibilities regardless of sex. It is unclear if both authors would agree that women's ethical obligations are often undervalued.
  D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
    - Beecher explicitly opposes women participating in political activism, while Grimké contends that if it is morally right for men, it is morally right for women as well.

Criticism:
  Based on the passages, it seems that the authors differ in many aspects related to women's responsibilities and roles in society. However, Claim A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities, is the one that both authors would likely agree upon, as they acknowledge women's unique roles and importance in society.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- Both passage 1 and passage 2 discuss the roles and responsibilities of women in society.
- Passage 1 claims that women have important duties and influence, but their influence should be limited to the domestic and social circles based on their moral nature.
- Passage 2 claims that human beings have rights and responsibilities based on their moral nature, not their sex. 

Thought:
A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
    - Both authors in the passages agree that women have some form of moral duties and responsibilities in society.

B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
    - Neither passage specifically focuses on the actions of men in regard to political change.

C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
    - Passage 1 suggests that women's roles are subordinate to men, but still important, while Passage 2 argues that their ethical responsibilities are equal. However, neither passage emphatically states that women's ethical obligations are undervalued.

D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
    - Passage 1 argues that women should not engage in political activities or conflicts, while Passage 2 asserts that women have the same moral rights as men, implying they should have the same opportunities for political activism. These viewpoints conflict, indicating that both authors would not agree with this claim.

Both authors would agree with choice A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities, as both passages address the moral roles and influence of women in society.

Criticism: 
- The analysis provides accurate information and reasoning from both passages to support the selection of choice A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Passage 1 Analysis:
Catharine Beecher, the author of this passage, argues that women have a subordinate role to men in society, but their duties and influence are not less important. She states that women should gain influence in a different way—through peace and love, within the domestic and social circle. She is against women taking on a combative stance or using coercive influences, such as involvement in the Abolition movement. 

Passage 2 Analysis:
In the second passage, Grimké, the author, counters Beecher's ideas by arguing that human rights and moral duties are not tied to sex. She points out that if rights come from our moral nature, then men and women should have equal rights and responsibilities. She states that what is morally right for men should also be morally right for women, implying that political activism and challenging societal norms should not be limited to men.

Choice Analysis:
A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities - Both authors mention that women have duties and responsibilities, although they differ on the extent and sphere of these responsibilities. This statement is supported by both passages.

B: Men often work selflessly for political change - Neither passage discusses men working selflessly for political change.

C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued - This statement can be inferred from Passage 2, since the author discusses the equal rights of women. However, Passage 1 argues that women's duties and influence are different from men's, but not less important. This statement may not be entirely agreed upon by both authors.

D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men - Passage 2 supports this statement, arguing for equal activism for both sexes. However, Passage 1 argues against women participating in "party conflict" or using coercive influences, which would encompass political activism.

Overall, Choice A is the one both authors would agree with.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1: Beecher argues that women hold a subordinate position in society, but their influence should be different and exercised through peace, love, and domestic life.
  Passage 2: Grimké states that the rights of all human beings, including women, grow out of their moral nature, and that whatever is morally right for men, is also right for women.

Thought:
  Option A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities:
    - Beecher: Women should exercise their influence through peace, love, and domestic life.
    - Grimké: Rights of all human beings, including women, grow out of their moral nature.

  Option B: Men often work selflessly for political change:
    - Beecher: Focuses on women's roles, not men working for political change.
    - Grimké: Focuses on the moral rights of all human beings, but doesn't specifically mention men working selflessly for political change.
  Result: Insufficient evidence in both passages to support this claim.

  Option C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued:
    - Beecher: Argues for the importance of women's influence in the domestic sphere, not the undervaluing of their obligations.
    - Grimké: Advocates for equal moral rights for women but doesn't directly state that the ethical obligations of women are undervalued.
  Result: Insufficient evidence in both passages to support this claim.

  Option D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men:
    - Beecher: Believes women should not be involved in political activism (opposed to the idea of involving women in the Abolition movement).
    - Grimké: Asserts that whatever is morally right for man to do is morally right for women, without explicitly stating the importance of political activism for both genders.
  Result: The authors do not agree on the importance of political activism for women.

The most suitable answer among the choices is option A, as it reflects the shared acknowledgment of moral duties and responsibilities for women by both authors.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Knowledge and Analysis:
Passage 1 is by Catharine Beecher, who argues that women should focus on their domestic and social roles, gaining influence through peace, love, and cooperation. She does not think that women should engage in public debate or coercive influence. Beecher believes that women do have important duties and influence.

Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher. Grimké argues that rights are based on our moral nature and not on our sex. Grimké believes that it is morally right for women to do what is morally right for men. She suggests that women's rights and duties are not limited to their domestic sphere.

Now let's analyze the choices:

A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities. Both authors agree that women have duties and responsibilities, although they disagree on the scope and nature of these duties.

B: Men often work selflessly for political change. This claim is not directly addressed by either author.

C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued. Although both authors acknowledge that women have ethical obligations, they disagree on the extent to which these obligations should be valued. Passage 1 argues that women's influence should be different and peculiar, while Passage 2 argues that women's rights and duties should be the same as men's.

D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men. Passage 1 argues that women should not engage in political activism, while Passage 2 argues that women have the same rights and duties as men.

The choice that both authors would agree with is A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Looking at each option, let's consider how the authors of the passages would agree or disagree with each claim:

A: Women have moral duties and responsibilities.
Passage 1 mentions that women have significant influence and have duties that are different yet important, and should focus on piety, charity, maternal and domestic duties. 
Passage 2 claims that rights and responsibilities grow out of one's moral nature and aren't dependent on sex, implying that women have moral duties and responsibilities.

B: Men often work selflessly for political change.
Neither passage discusses whether men work selflessly for political change or not.

C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
Passage 1 depicts women's role as subordinate, so it can be inferred that the author believes women's ethical obligations might be undervalued. 
However, Passage 2 is advocating for equal rights for women based on their moral nature, so the author is underlining that women's moral obligations are of equal importance to those of men, not undervalued.

D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
Passage 1 states that women should not be involved in political activism, as it is not within their appropriate sphere.
Passage 2 states that morally, women have the right to do anything that men can do, which can be interpreted as being supportive of women's political activism.

Based on the information provided in the passages, neither passage appears to agree with options B, C, or D. Option A is the only choice that is supported by both passages: both authors agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities, though they might differ on the scope of these duties.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open

Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

Choices:
  A: Passage 1 does not mention data derived from computer simulations.
  B: Both passages address the brains of human ancestors; Passage 1 discusses genetic differences between humans and other primates.
  C: Passage 1 focuses on the role of NOTCH2NL genes in brain evolution, but does not limit its discussion to recent human history.
  D: Passage 1 focuses on the influence of specific genetic changes (NOTCH2NL genes) on human brain evolution, while Passage 2 discusses population-level changes (larger-brained species) as a factor in brain evolution.

Thought:
Since both passages consider the brains of human ancestors and compare them to other primate species at different points, options B and C don't describe a key difference between the two passages. The passages differ in that Passage 1 focuses on a specific gene and its relation to human brain size, while Passage 2 considers the influence of large-scale population-level changes, such as the emergence of larger-brained species and the extinction of smaller-brained species.

Criticism:
Choice A can be dismissed because Passage 1 doesn't mention computer simulations. Choice B doesn't accurately describe a difference because both passages address human ancestors and other primate species. Choice C doesn't seem accurate since both passages consider changes in brain size occurring over long periods, although with a different focus. Choice D accurately distinguishes the passages by focusing on the different factors each passage examines.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Passage 1: 
- Discusses the discovery of the NOTCH2NL gene and its relation to brain size in humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. 
- Focuses on genetic factors (NOTCH2NL gene) responsible for large human neocortex.

Passage 2:
- Discusses a fossil study that shows an increase in brain size over the past three million years in hominins, which includes human ancestors.
- Focuses on three factors that contributed to the increase in average brain size: within-species evolution, new larger-brained species, and extinction of small-brained species.

Choices:
A: Both passages don't discuss computer simulations explicitly. Hence, not the best choice.
B: Passage 1 is more about genetic factors in human brain development and does mention comparisons to other primates, but it doesn't focus on genetic analysis in the brains of multiple primate species. Passage 2 is more about the trend in increasing brain size and doesn't focus on genetic analyses. Hence, not the best choice.
C: Passage 1 doesn't limit its discussion to recent human history, it talks about genetic factors evolving over millions of years. Passage 2, on the other hand, considers changes over the past three million years. Hence, not the best choice.
D: Passage 1 focuses on the NOTCH2NL gene and how it influenced brain evolution, while Passage 2 focuses on factors that contributed to the increase in average brain size, including evolution within species, new larger-brained species, and the extinction of smaller-brained species. This choice highlights a key difference between the two passages.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- Passage 1 discusses the discovery of the NOTCH2NL gene, its relationship to brain development, and how it is unique to humans and their recent relatives like Neanderthals and Denisovans. It also mentions the timing of the gene's emergence, which corresponds to when the ancestors' craniums began to enlarge in the fossil record.
- Passage 2 talks about the gradual and consistent increase in average brain size over the past three million years, based on an analysis of 94 hominin fossils. The research shows that the larger brain size is primarily due to evolution within individual species but is also influenced by the introduction of larger-brained species and the extinction of smaller-brained ones.

Thought:
- Comparing the two passages, we can identify the key differences between them.

Criticism:
- Option A: Neither passage specifically mentions data derived from computer simulations; therefore, this option is not correct.
- Option B: Passage 2 does not specifically address genetic analyses of the brains of multiple primate species; it talks about an analysis of hominin fossil skull volumes. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
- Option C: Passage 1 and Passage 2 both cover changes over millions of years, so this option does not accurately describe a key difference between the passages.
- Option D: Passage 1 does focus on a specific gene responsible for humans' brain development, while Passage 2 discusses the overall gradual increase in brain size considering population-level factors. This choice highlights a key difference between the two passages.

Action: Answer("D")

Evaluation of the passage and choice options:

Passage 1:
- Focuses on the NOTCH2NL gene and its potential role in human brain development.
- Considers how the NOTCH2NL gene came to be part of the human genome and how it may have influenced human brain size.
- The passage discusses the gene in relation to human-specific genetic factors and also addresses the comparison with other primate species.

Passage 2:
- Examines the gradual increase in brain size over the past three million years in different hominin species.
- Looks at factors contributing to the larger brains, including evolution within individual species, the introduction of larger-brained species, and the extinction of smaller-brained species.
- Focuses more on the pattern of brain size increase rather than specific genetic factors.

Choice evaluation:

A: Both passages derive their conclusions from empirical data that include fossil evidence, so this choice does not identify a key difference between the passages.

B: Passage 1 indeed focuses primarily on genetic analyses in human ancestors. However, while Passage 2 does talk about human fossils, it does not specifically focus on genetic analyses of the brains of multiple primate species. Therefore, this choice is not the best fit.

C: Both passages discuss changes occurring over a long time scale, so this difference is not accurate.

D: This choice is the most accurate depiction of the differences between the passages. Passage 1 primarily focuses on specific genetic changes, particularly the NOTCH2NL gene and its potential influence on brain size. In contrast, Passage 2 looks more broadly at patterns of brain size increase, considering larger-scale population-level changes.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

  C: fewer political parties are competing for people’s votes.
  D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  From the passage, Parsons explains their shift in thinking from believing that the government could alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed to understanding that governments tend to use power in the interest of the few at the expense of the many. They realized that political parties, once in power, do not necessarily focus on their promises to the people but on remaining in power and building a strong machine to control and silence opposition. They also expressed concerns about the potential abuse of power by political parties and their interest in non-political socialism and Anarchism.

Thoughts:
  A: Masses of people being well-versed in political history may help them make informed decisions but this is not directly mentioned by Parsons as a factor for positive social change.

  A: The passage does not emphasize the masses needing to be well-versed in political history to create positive social change.
  B: Parsons seems skeptical of political parties and their commitment to reform once they're in power.
  C: The passage does not discuss the number of political parties as a factor in positive social change.
  D: Parsons mentions that positive change takes place only when governments can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, which highlights the importance of vocal individuals raising their concerns.

Criticism: 
  The reasoning seems accurate, as choice D most closely aligns with the ideas presented in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Parsons discusses her journey realizing that governments concentrate power and can wield it in the interest of the few, often silencing the voice of discontent among the people.
- She argues that relying on government-controlled political parties is dangerous for a society's progress and individuals' full development.
- Parsons turned to anarchism due to its philosophy which aims to empower individual units.

Thought:
- From the passage, we can see that Parsons believes positive change will happen when people challenge the oppressive nature of governments.
- She discusses the consequences of having political parties having control of many aspects of society.
- Therefore, the change will happen when vocal individuals address their concerns against the government, pushing it to address their issues.

Criticism:
- The thought process seems accurate and logical based on the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The author talks about their experience in social reform movements
- The author states that they thought government could help alleviate the suffering of the oppressed, but they now believe it cannot
- Governments tend to follow progress, not lead it
- Political parties mainly focus on staying in power and building up a powerful machine
- The author fears giving too much control to a political party because the party in power may silence the voice of the minority and retard the progress
- The author believes in the non-political phase of Socialism - Anarchism, as it allows for the fullest development of individual units in society without government restrictions

Thought:
- The passage indicates that the author does not believe that political parties will lead to positive change, as they mainly focus on staying in control and could potentially silence the voice of the minority
- The author believes that positive social change can only take place when individual freedom is prioritized over government control, as seen in their support for non-political Socialism - Anarchism
- The author's position suggests that positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns, as allowing for individual development without government restrictions will encourage progress

Conclusion:
- Based on the passage and the author's belief in non-political Socialism - Anarchism, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
- The passage presents Parsons' thoughts on political parties and government and his transition from political socialism to anarchism.
- Parsons believes political parties exist to maintain power and control, often at the expense of the public good.
- He is concerned about the potential for abuse of power by political parties in control and the silencing of opposition voices.
- Parsons turned to anarchism because he believes it can better support the individual's development, while government restrictions cannot achieve this.

Thoughts:
- A: masses of people are well versed in political history - The passage does not specifically indicate that knowledge of political history is the key to positive social change.
- B: political parties become committed to reform - The passage talks about Parsons's skepticism towards political parties and their promises, so it is unlikely that he would believe in their commitment to reform.
- C: fewer political parties are competing for people’s votes - The passage does not discuss the number of competing political parties as a factor in social change.
- D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns - The passage emphasizes how governments often try to silence protesting minorities, with progress occurring only when they can no longer do so. This choice aligns with the author's view on how progress can be made.

Criticism: 
- After analyzing the choices and the passage, choice D appears to be the most closely aligned with Parsons' view on how positive social change can occur.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted that those nerves only responded to two types of  stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressureand vibration were believed to travel only along myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also give information about location. Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping 10 the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.15 Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure might be active in humans as well as in other mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young20 volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. Using a technique called microneurography, in which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able25 to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will30 reach the brain about a half second later. This delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers-about 1 meter/second-confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fast-35 conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and $75 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named these "low-threshold" nerves "C-tactile," or CT,40 fibers, said Olausson, because of their "exquisite sensitivity" to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.But why exactly humans might have such fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of rather45 subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found only in hairy human skin-such as the forearm and thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin, such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted50 similar activity signatures. Olausson and his colleagues decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.Although microneurography can give55 information about how a single nerve responds to gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the$60 \mathrm{arm}$, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?To address the question, Olausson's group sought65 out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had developed numbness across many parts of her body after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever. Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to 70 pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated 75 fibers were intact.Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush80 strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found, she felt nothing.Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine 85 which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers90 brushed G.L.'s arm. This solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed, specifically provide pleasurable sensations
Question: It can reasonably be inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the
Choices:
  A: precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.
  B: relationship between body hair and CT fiber function.
  C: role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain.
  D: effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the research conducted by Olausson and his colleagues on slow fibers and the discovery of C-tactile (CT) fibers. 
  In 1999, the group closely studied the characteristics of these slow fibers and named them "C-tactile" or "CT fibers" due to their sensitivity to slow, gentle tactile stimulation and unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks. 
  Microneurography is a technique used to measure the electrical impulses of single nerves.

Thought: 
  A: The precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey - This option seems related to the researchers' curiosity about the slow fibers' characteristics and their response to different types of stimuli.
  B: The relationship between body hair and CT fiber function - This option does not seem directly relevant to the 1999 experiment's goals, as it focuses on the connection between body hair and fiber function, rather than on the characteristics and sensitivities of the fibers themselves.
  C: The role played by CT fibers in the perception of pain - This option may not be the primary focus of the 1999 experiment, as the passage states that CT fibers are unresponsive to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
  D: The effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling - This option seems more related to the methodology of the experiments rather than understanding the characteristics and function of CT fibers.

Criticism: 
  Options B and D appear to be less relevant to the goals of the 1999 experiment as described in the passage. The primary focus was to study CT fibers and their sensitivity to gentle tactile stimulation and their unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli. 
  Option C states the perception of pain, but the passage describes CT fibers as unresponsive to painful stimuli, thus this option seems not to be a goal of the 1999 experiment.
  Option A discusses the nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey, which aligns well with the passage's description of the researchers seeking to understand the characteristics of slow fibers, such as their sensitivity to specific types of stimuli.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: A pair of recent studies suggests that although.industrialized nations may have benefitted from larger.cities, the same is not true for the rapidly urbanizing areas of.the developing world. In these parts of the globe, there really.might be such a thing as too much urbanization, too.quickly..The studies, by Susanne A. Frick and Andrés Rodríguez-.Pose of the London School of Economics, take a close look.at the actual connection between city size and nationwide.economic performance. Their initial study, from last year,.examines the relationship between economic development,.as measured by GDP per capita, and average metropolitan-.area size in 114 countries across the world between 1960.and 2010. To ensure robustness, it controls for variables.including national population size, physical land area,.education levels, economic openness, and other factors..The size of cities or metro areas across the world has.exploded over the past half-century, with cities in the.developing world growing much faster and much larger.than those in more developed nations. Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew.modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median.city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding.from 220,000 to 845,000 people. In 1960, 12 of the top 20.countries with the largest average city size were high-.income countries; by 2010, 14 of the top 20 were in the.developing world..Urbanization has historically been thought of as a.necessary feature of economic development and growth, but.this study finds the connection is not so simple. While.advanced nations benefit from having larger cities,.developing nations do not. Advanced nations experience a 0.7 percent increase in economic growth for every.additional 100,000 in average population among its large.cities over a five-year period. But for developing nations, the.addition of 100,000 people in large cities is associated with a 2.3 percent decrease in economic growth over a five-year.period..In their latest study, the researchers found that.developing nations tend to get a bigger bang for their buck.from smaller and medium-size cities. These countries see.the most economic benefit from having a larger proportion.of their urban population living in cities of 500,000 people.or less. Bigger cities tend to have a more positive economic.impact in larger countries. Having a metro with more than 10 million inhabitants produces a nationwide economic.benefit only if the total urban population is 28.5 million.or more, according to the study. This makes sense:.Bigger, more developed countries are more likely to play.host to knowledge-based industries that require urban.agglomeration economies..There are several reasons why megacities^1 often fail to.spur significant growth in the rapidly urbanizing world..For one, the lion’s share of places that are urbanizing.most rapidly today are in the poorest and least-.developed parts of the world, whereas the places that.urbanized a century or so ago were in the richest and.most developed. This history has created a false.expectation that urbanization is always associated with.prosperity..Additionally, globalization has severed the historical.connection between cities, local agriculture, and local.industry that powered the more balanced urban.economic development of the past. In today’s globally.interconnected economy, the raw materials that flowed.from the surrounding countryside to the city can all be.inexpensively imported from other parts of the world..The result is that the connection between large cities and.growth has now become much more tenuous, producing.a troubling new pattern of “urbanization without.growth.”.The researchers used multiple variables to calculate a weighted average.city size for each country studied and reported the median of those.averages..(^1) Typically defined as cities with populations of over ten million people

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

Passage 2:
- The author discusses how society has changed from the inequality-based "dominion of the strongest" to moving towards just equality.
- It was expected that the relationship between men and women, being connected with strong emotions, would be the last to change from the old rule to the new.
- Emphasizes that all occupations should be open to both sexes, and the most capable will perform best.
- Implies this change supports greater equality.

Consideration of choices:

A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
- Both authors discuss changes in gender roles that promote greater equality.

B: unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
- Neither author suggests that the changes in gender roles would be more costly than beneficial.

C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
- While both authors touch on the benefits of gender equality, they do not emphasize the economic advantages as the main reason for inevitability.

D: at odds with the principles of American democracy.
- Passage 1 author agrees with America's approach to gender roles in a democratic context, so it would not be at odds with American democracy.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Passage 1 summary: The author argues that democratic equality between men and women should not mean making them identical in roles and responsibilities, but rather recognizing their differences and allowing them to excel in their respective tasks.

Passage 2 summary: The author believes that society is moving towards greater equality, and that allowing both men and women the freedom to choose their roles and occupations will result in the best outcome for society as a whole.

Let's consider each choice in relation to the passages:

A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality. 
Both authors seem to agree on this point, as noted in their respective summaries.

B: unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
Neither author expresses this view. Both imply that the changes will benefit society.

C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
While both authors may believe in the advantages of gender equality, they do not explicitly state that it is the economic advantages that make it inevitable.

D: at odds with the principles of American democracy.
Neither author mentions this, and the first author even uses the American understanding of democratic equality between the sexes as a positive example.

Based on the analysis, the best answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

Relevant knowledge:
Passage 1 discusses how democratic equality has the potential to raise women and make them more equal to men. It states that the American understanding of democratic equality between the sexes accepts that there are inherent differences between men and women and aims to allow them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner, rather than forcing both sexes to do the same things.

Passage 2 talks about how society is moving towards a just equality in human relations, replacing the dominion of the strongest. Furthermore, the author argues that the best sphere for all human beings is that which they can attain, and that all occupations should be open to all men and women, allowing them to prove their capabilities through trial. This would allow society to benefit from everyone's best faculties.

Thought:
A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality - Both authors seem to agree that changes in gender roles are part of a movement towards greater equality in society.
B: unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs - Neither author explicitly states that the changes are not worth the potential costs.
C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality - Passage 1 mentions that the American approach to democratic equality between the sexes is designed to aid the "great work of society," but it does not specifically mention economic advantages as the driving force. Passage 2 does discuss the benefits to society but does not specifically focus on economic advantages as the sole or primary reason.
D: at odds with the principles of American democracy - Passage 1 actually praises the American understanding of democratic equality between the sexes, so this option is not consistent with the author's view.

Critical Evaluation:
Based on the information provided in both passages, A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality seems to be the answer that best represents the views of both authors. They both discuss changes in gender roles as part of a broader shift towards greater equality and more just societies.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- Both passages discuss gender roles and the concept of equality.
- Passage 1 states that Americans view the distinction between male and female roles as part of nature, and the division of duties between the sexes helps society function better.
- Passage 2 suggests that society is moving toward a principle of equal rights and opportunities, with the individual's abilities determining their occupation, not their gender.

Thought:
- To find the answer, we need to determine which statement both authors would most likely agree with.
- A: Both passages discuss changes in society toward greater equality and how gender roles play a part in this progression.
- B: Neither passage explicitly states that changes in gender roles would be unlikely to provide benefits outweighing their costs. Passage 1 implies that the proper distinction between male and female roles is beneficial, while Passage 2 argues that society benefits from allowing individuals to reach their full potential.
- C: Neither passage presents the idea that gender equality's economic advantages make these changes inevitable; rather, they focus on societal and philosophical shifts.
- D: Neither passage states that changes in gender roles are at odds with the principles of American democracy. Passage 1 discusses the American perspective on the division of labor between the sexes, while Passage 2 focuses on societal shifts in general.

Criticism:
- My reasoning appears sound in determining that answer A best encapsulates the shared view of both authors.

Action: Answer("A")

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses an experimental study on woodpecker finches and their tool use.
  A novel levering technique was discovered in the study which was different from the typical tool-using behavior observed in woodpecker finches.
Thought:
  Based on the passage, the researchers conclude that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning. The following information in the passage can be connected to the answer choices:
  A: The passage does not mention any genetic variations in connection with the novel levering technique.
  B: The passage does not mention any alteration of the artificial crevices and the effect of that on the technique.
  C: The passage states that the birds developed the technique due to the artificial crevices and significantly increased their use of this method after initial success, which may indicate individual learning.
  D: The passage does mention that the artificial crevices inspired the novel technique, but does not explain if a similar naturally occurring circumstance would have favored the development of that technique.

Criticism:
  A: The passage does not provide any information about genetic variations connected to the novel levering technique, so it doesn't support the conclusion.
  B: The passage does not mention any alteration of the artificial crevices, so this choice isn't related to the conclusion.
  C: Although the novel levering technique takes place inside a crevice, the passage emphasizes that the technique was developed and increased due to individual learning and not because it was difficult to observe by other finches.
  D: The passage does not discuss the probability of naturally occurring circumstances favoring the development of the novel levering technique or its transmission to those finches.

Based on the information provided in the passage, choice C seems to be the best answer as it shows that the development and use of the novel levering technique are associated with individual learning rather than social learning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
- The passage states that woodpecker finches were used in a study to investigate whether tool use is acquired socially.
- The study found that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of tool use in woodpecker finches.
- The development of tool use in woodpecker finches is based on a specific genetic predisposition, but can be enhanced through individual learning.
- Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the wild birds, most likely because the artificial crevices differed from natural ones.
- These birds increased their use of the novel method after initial success.

Thought:
- Based on the passage, the researchers' conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported because:
    - The passage gave examples of how these finches developed tool-using techniques that deviated from natural techniques.
    - Due to the circumstances under which these techniques were discovered, it can be inferred that they were learned individually and not socially.

Analyze the choices:
  A: The passage doesn't mention anything about genetic variations in the finches.
  B: The passage does not mention the researchers altering the artificial crevices or finches stopping to use the technique.
  C: The passage mentions that the novel technique takes place inside the artificial crevice, which could make it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.
  D: The passage doesn't discuss any naturally occurring circumstances that would have favored the development of the technique.

Criticism:
- The best choice is C, as it supports the researchers' conclusion that the finches displaying the novel levering technique were learning individually because the techniques that deviate from the wild behaviors take place inside a crevice, which makes it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Passage Summary:
- Researchers split the woodpecker finches' broods into two groups: one group was reared with a tool-using model, the other one without a tool-using model.
- The finches without the opportunity to observe tool use still developed the ability.
- Social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of tool use in woodpecker finches; it's mostly based on genetic components.
- The passage explains that individual learning does improve the efficiency of tool use, and it is evident by five individuals who developed a novel levering technique.

Choices Analysis:
A: The passage doesn't mention any genetic variations among the woodpecker finches that used the novel levering technique.
B: The passage doesn't mention that the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the novel levering technique.
C: This choice matches the description in the passage. The finches using this novel levering technique that deviates from typical tool use, indicating individual learning since they developed this method on their own.
D: The passage doesn't discuss whether there could be a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.

Thinking Step-by-step:
- The passage discusses an experiment on woodpecker finches and the role of social vs. individual learning.
- Five individuals developed a novel levering technique, showcasing individual learning.
- The question asks for a choice that supports the conclusion of individual learning.

Critically Evaluating:
- Choices A, B, and D don't have relevant information or support in the passage.
- Choice C matches the description and supports the conclusion of individual learning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Passage analysis:
The researchers conducted an experiment to study the development of twig tool use in woodpecker finches. They found that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in these birds. Instead, the developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components. However, individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use, serving to improve its efficiency. Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from tool use performed by birds in the wild. After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method. This observation supports the idea that individual learning enhances the behavior.

Choices analysis:
A: The passage doesn't mention any genetic variations common to all those finches.
B: The passage doesn't mention that the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
C: The passage indicates that the novel levering technique is used inside a crevice, making it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially. This supports the idea that this behavior was developed through individual learning.
D: The passage doesn't provide any information about naturally occurring circumstances that would have favored the development of the technique.

Conclusion:
Based on the passage analysis and choices analysis, the best answer is Option C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The researchers observed woodpecker finches using a novel levering technique.
- The birds displayed individual learning by using this technique.
- Individual learning refers to acquiring knowledge or skills without social influence.

Thoughts:
- A: The passage doesn't mention genetic variations in finches that did or did not use the technique.
- B: The passage doesn't mention altering the crevices, nor finches stopping the technique.
- C: If the technique is difficult to observe due to occurring inside a crevice, it suggests individual learning rather than social learning.
- D: The passage states that artificial crevices differed from natural ones, but doesn't provide evidence of a naturally occurring circumstance favoring the technique or prior transmission.

Criticism:
- A: Not supported by the passage.
- B: Not supported by the passage.
- C: Supported by the passage, as the technique occurred inside the crevice, making it difficult for others to observe.
- D: Although the passage mentions differences between artificial and natural crevices, it doesn't establish a lack of naturally occurring circumstances favoring the technique.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
The passage discussed an experimental study on woodpecker finches and tool use acquisition. It points out that some individuals developed tool-using techniques different from those observed in the wild, which they called levering technique. This technique is considered as an example of individual learning.

A: The passage does not mention any genetic variations in the finches that used the novel levering technique.
B: The passage does not talk about altering the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
C: The passage states that the five birds increased their use of the levering technique after initial success, which indicates that they learned it individually.
D: The passage suggests that the levering technique is probably unique to the artificial crevice setting in the experiment.

Thought: 
The question asks which of the options supports the conclusion that the finches' levering technique is an example of individual learning.

A: The passage does not mention genetic variations as a supporting factor for the conclusion.
B: The passage does not discuss the researchers altering the artificial crevices to reduce the technique's effectiveness.
C: The fact that the birds increased their use of the levering technique after initial success indicates individual learning.
D: The unique levering technique being specific to the artificial crevice setting could be a reason why this method has not been observed in the wild and support the conclusion that it was a result of individual learning.

Criticism: 
A, B, C, and D options have been thoroughly considered. The choice D seems to be the most fitting, as it supports the conclusion that the woodpecker finches' levering technique is an example of individual learning.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The researchers concluded that the development of tool use in woodpecker finches is based on a very specific genetic predisposition but is enhanced through individual learning.
- Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, apparently due to the difference between artificial and natural crevices.
- After initial success with this new technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.

Thought process:
- Option A: The passage does not mention any information about genetic variations specific to the novel levering technique users.
- Option B: The passage does not mention that the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
- Option C: While it is true that the part of the technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior occurs inside a crevice, making it difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially, this is not the main support for the researchers' conclusion. Their conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the five birds increased their use of this novel technique after their initial success.
- Option D: The passage suggests that artificial crevices used in the experiment differed from natural crevices and tree holes, which in turn might have influenced the development of the new technique. This information supports the researchers' conclusion that individual learning played a role in tool-using behavior.

Criticism:
- Options A and B can be ruled out due to the lack of related information in the passage.
- Option C is not the main reason for the conclusion. The researchers are focusing on the fact that birds were able to discover and improve this novel technique by themselves, showing individual learning, which is not covered by this option.
- Option D is the best choice because it addresses that individual learning is supported by the fact that woodpecker finches developed a new technique due to the difference between artificial and natural crevices, suggesting that the birds learned this new technique individually.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
- Woodpecker finches are the main subject of the study.
- The researchers are investigating whether tool use is socially acquired or not.
- The study involved splitting broods into groups raised with a tool-using model and non-tool-using model.
- The findings show that both groups developed the ability to use tools without social learning, suggesting a genetic basis.
- Five individuals developed a novel tool-using technique involving levering the prey.
- The technique seemed to be developed due to the artificial crevices in the study.

Thought:
- To support the conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning, we should look for evidence in the passage demonstrating individual adaptation or enhancement of behavior.

Options analysis:
A: The passage doesn't mention any specific genetic variations related to the novel levering technique.
B: The passage doesn't discuss altering the artificial crevices to reduce the technique's effectiveness or the finches' reactions to it.
C: The passage states that the levering technique occurs within crevices, making it difficult for other finches to observe. This implies individual learning as they adapt to the artificial crevices within their own experiences.
D: The passage doesn't mention the likelihood of encountering natural circumstances specifically related to the novel levering technique.

Criticism:
- Though option D is tempting, it does not specifically provide evidence that supports the conclusion of individual learning.
- Option C presents the best evidence for individual learning, as the technique developed within the crevices, making it hard for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The news is a form of public knowledge..Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the.health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a.Line private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge.increases in value as it is shared by more people. The.date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;.the causes and consequences of an environmental.disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular.law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all.examples of public knowledge that people are.generally expected to know in order to be considered.informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or.private knowledge, which is generally left to.individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is.promoted even to those who might not think it.matters to them. In short, the circulation of public.knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded.as a public good which cannot be solely.demand-driven..The production, circulation, and reception.of public knowledge is a complex process. It is.generally accepted that public knowledge should.be authoritative, but there is not always.common agreement about what the public needs to.know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and.how authoritative reputations should be determined.and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The.Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely.regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative.agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied.the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of.authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the.opinions of others.” As part of the general process of.the transformation of authority whereby there has.been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional.sources of public knowledge, the demand has been.for all authority to make explicit the frames of value.which determine their decisions. Centres of news.production, as our focus groups show, have not been.exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps.some news journalists feel uneasy about this.renegotiation of their authority:.Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the.“most read” lists on their own and other websites.to work out which stories matter to readers and.viewers. And now the audience—which used to.know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of.journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our.credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008)..The result of democratising access to TV news.could be political disengagement by the majority.and a dumbing down through a popularity.contest of stories (online news editor, 2007)..Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,.they amount to more than straightforward.professional defensiveness. In their reference to an.audience “which used to know its place” and.conflation between democratisation and “dumbing.down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular.mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by.experts, immune from populist pressures; and.disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive.recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down.opportunities for popular involvement in the making.of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional.claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are.right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every.institutional level in contemporary society,.scepticism towards the epistemological authority of.expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed.by several of our focus group participants, that the.news media should be “informative rather than.authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to.“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their.slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient.information” from which “we would be able to form.opinions of our own.”.At stake here are two distinct conceptions of.authority. The journalists we have quoted are.resistant to the democratisation of news:.the supremacy of the clickstream (according to.which editors raise or lower the profile of stories.according to the number of readers clicking on them.online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”.news; the demands of some audience members for.raw news rather than constructed narratives.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden  with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are 5 the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the10 procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those15 doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty20 years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that25 makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively30 no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us35 then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old40 family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so 45 long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The0 questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that55 procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will60 object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men65 have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our70 brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the75 gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this "civilization" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in80 them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?
Question: According to the passage, Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it
Choices:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline& \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\text { pathogen }\end{array}$} \\\hlinePathogen & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies with } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Colonies without } \\ \text { colony collapse } \\ \text { disorder (\%) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Adapted from Diana L. Cox-Foster et al., "A Metagenomic Survey of Microbes in Honey Bee Colony Collapse Disorder." @2007 by American Association for the Advancement of Science.The table above shows, for colonies with colony collapse disorder and for colonies without colony collapse disorder, the percent of colonies having honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together
Question: Do the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections?
Choices:
  A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
- The question asks if the data in the table support the authors' claim that Varroa mite infection increases honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections
- Colony Collapse Disorder is a phenomenon where bees leave their hives and do not return, leading to the collapse of the colony
- The claim is that mite infection is making the honeybees more susceptible to secondary infections
- A: Evidence about the cause of colony collapse disorder is not what the question is asking
- B: Comparing the percent of colonies infected in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder seems relevant to the question
- C: Evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder is not what the question is asking
- D: Evidence on whether honeybees had been infected with mites is relevant to the question

Thought:
- The table shows the percent of colonies with and without colony collapse disorder affected by different pathogens
- The table provides information on viruses and fungi, but not specifically Varroa mites
- The question asks if the table provides support for the authors' claim about Varroa mites increasing a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections

Criticism:
- The table does not provide specific information about Varroa mite infections and their effect on secondary infections
- A, C, and D are not appropriate answers because they do not address the relationship between Varroa mite infections and secondary infections
- B seems to be the answer that is closest to discussing the susceptibility to secondary infections but it is not specifically related to Varroa mite infections

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
The question asks for support for the claim that varroa mite infection increases honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
-The table does not mention varroa mites but shows the percentage of colonies affected by four types of pathogens and the cases of colony collapse disorder.

Thought:
-The question looks for a cause and effect relationship between varroa mite infection and increased susceptibility to secondary infections.
-However, the table shows the percentage of colonies affected by four pathogens and their association with colony collapse disorder but does not include varroa mite data.

Criticism:
-The data in the table do not provide any information about varroa mite infection, which is necessary to assess the claim.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses the possible relationship between Varroa mites, secondary infections, and colony collapse disorder. However, the table does not include any data about Varroa mite infection in colonies. The table presents data on four pathogens in colonies with and without the colony collapse disorder.

Thought:
  The question asks if the data support the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. To determine this, we need data that directly relates to the relationship between Varroa mite infections and secondary infections.
  
  A: The table does not provide evidence on the relationship between pathogen infection and colony collapse disorder.
  B: While the table shows a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder being infected by each pathogen, it does not specifically address the relationship between Varroa mite infections and secondary infections.
  C: Bacterial infections could be an additional cause of colony collapse disorder, but the table does not provide evidence for this claim. Furthermore, this option does not directly address the relationship between Varroa mite infections and secondary infections.
  D: The data lack information on whether the honeybees in the colonies had been infected with Varroa mites.

Criticism:
  Our focus needs to be on the relationship between Varroa mite infections and secondary infections.

Conclusion:
  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites. This choice is the most accurate because the table lacks crucial information about Varroa mite infections, making it impossible to conclude whether the data support the authors' claim.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The question asks if the data support the claim that Varroa mite infection increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
- The table displays data about honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder, showing the percent of colonies affected by different pathogens.

Evaluation of Choices:
A: The table does show a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder being affected by various pathogens, but it does not provide evidence that mite infection caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
B: This statement is accurate, as the percentages of colonies infected with each pathogen are higher for colonies with colony collapse disorder compared to those without it. However, it doesn't directly show the link between mite infections and secondary infections.
C: This choice focuses on bacteria, which is not the main problem discussed in the passage, so it is not relevant to the question.
D: This choice highlights the absence of information about mite infections in the table, which is the main issue in the authors' claim.

So, neither the data nor the choices provided a clear support for the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections since there's a lack of information about mite infections.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:

- The question asks if the data in the table supports the claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
- Varroa mites are not mentioned in the table.
- The table shows that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.

Thought:
- The data shows information about the frequencies of infections of different pathogens in colonies with colony collapse disorder and colonies without colony collapse disorder.
- However, the data does not indicate if the honeybees had been infected with varroa mites, which is essential to determine if there's a correlation or not.
- Considering the missing information regarding varroa mites infection, the data does not provide sufficient evidence to support the authors' claim.

Criticism:
- The thoughts are consistent with the given information and cover all important aspects of the question.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Relevant Knowledge:
- The authors claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
- The table shows the percentage of colonies affected by various pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.

Thoughts:
- If the table provides evidence that honeybees infected with Varroa mites are more susceptible to secondary infections, it would support the authors' claim.
  
Analysis of Each Option:
A: The table provides percentages of colonies affected by various pathogens. It doesn't provide direct evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colony collapse disorder. So, this option is incorrect.

B: The percentages of colonies infected with each pathogen are higher in colonies with colony collapse disorder than in colonies without colony collapse disorder. This suggests that there might be a connection between colony collapse disorder and the increased presence of pathogens. However, the table does not provide information about Varroa mite infections. So, this option is also incorrect.

C: The table does not provide information about bacteria, but the authors' claim concerns the Varroa mites' impact on honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections. The lack of data about bacteria does not answer the question of whether the data supports their claim. So, this option is incorrect.

D: The table provides information about the presence of pathogens in honeybee colonies but does not include information on Varroa mite infections. Since the authors' claim concerns the impact of Varroa mites on honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections, the absence of Varroa mite information makes it impossible to determine if the data supports their claim. So, this option is correct.

Critical Evaluation:
After analyzing each option, it is clear that option D is the correct answer because the data in the table do not provide information about Varroa mite infections, which is necessary to determine if the data supports the authors' claim.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
   Varroa mites can cause honeybees to be more susceptible to secondary infections.
   The question asks if the table provides support for this claim.
   A: The data showing infection with a pathogen doesn't necessarily support the claim about varroa mites.
   B: The data showing higher infection rates for colonies with colony collapse disorder may support the claim if it is due to varroa mite infections.
   C: The absence of evidence about bacteria doesn't directly support or refute the claim about varroa mite infections.
   D: The data not indicating honeybee mite infections would be crucial to the claim about varroa mites.

Thought:
   The table lists percentages of colonies infected with each pathogen and whether they have colony collapse disorder.
   Varroa mites are not mentioned in the table, so it's unclear if this data is a result of varroa mite infections.
   The statement about mites is not supported by the table because it doesn't mention varroa mites.

Criticism:
   The table does not provide information about varroa mite infections nor their connection to secondary infections.
   Therefore, it doesn't support the claim about varroa mites increasing honeybee susceptibility to secondary infections.
   
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  - Varroa mites are known to increase a honey bee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  - The question asks if the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

Thought:
  - The table does not directly mention varroa mites, but it presents data about the percent of colonies infected with various pathogens and experiencing colony collapse disorder (CCD).

Option analysis:
  A: The data provide evidence that there is an increase in pathogen presence in colonies with CCD compared to colonies without CCD. However, this does not directly provide evidence that infection with varroa mites increases susceptibility to secondary infections.

  B: This option is true as the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with CCD than for colonies without CCD. However, it does not directly provide evidence that varroa mites increase susceptibility to secondary infections, only that a greater presence of pathogens is correlated with CCD.

  C: The data do not provide information about bacteria as a cause of CCD. However, the question is about whether the table supports the claim about the effect of varroa mites on susceptibility to secondary infections.

  D: This option is correct. The data do not indicate whether honeybees had been infected with mites, so there is insufficient information to support the claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honey bee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

Criticism: 
  - All options have been thoroughly analyzed based on the information provided in the table and the context of the question.
  - The data present in the table does not directly address or provide evidence for the authors' claim about the effect of varroa mite infection on honey bee susceptibility to secondary infections.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Relevant knowledge:
- The question asks whether the table data supports the claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
- The claim focuses on the connection between Varroa mites and secondary infections.
- The table does not mention mite infections; it shows the percent of colonies affected by each pathogen and all four pathogens together.

Step-by-step thoughts:
1. The table data shows a correlation between colony collapse disorder and the percentage of colonies affected by pathogens.
2. The data does not specifically talk about honeybees infected with mites.
3. The question asks whether the table data provides support for the claim that mite infection increases susceptibility to secondary infections, not whether the table data shows a correlation between infection and colony collapse disorder.

Critical evaluation:
- Even though there is a noticeable pattern in the table data between colony collapse disorder and pathogen infections, it does not directly answer the question about the relationship between mite infections and secondary infections.
- The data does not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Recall:
- The context presents information about honeybees and how Varroa mites impact them.
- The table shows the percentages of colonies affected by pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
- Varroa mites are not listed in the table.

Choices:
A: The data shows the association between the pathogens and colony collapse disorder, but it does not provide information about the presence of Varroa mites, so the answer is not A.
B: The percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder, but this doesn't indicate a direct connection between Varroa mite infections and secondary infections since the Varroa mites are not listed. So, the answer is not B.
C: The table does not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder, but this statement does not address the primary claim about Varroa mites and secondary infections. So, the answer is not C.
D: The data does not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites, which is the primary claim in question. The answer seems to be D.

Thought process:
The question asks whether the data provides evidence for the connection between Varroa mite infection and increased susceptibility to secondary infections in honeybees. The table does not provide any information about Varroa mites, so it can't support the claim.

Criticism:
There is no flaw in the reasoning. The answer is accurate based on the data in the table and the context of the question.

Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Response 5:
Recap of relevant knowledge:
The passage is about a woman named Lady Carlotta, who gets off a train at a station, helps a cart-horse in distress, and misses the train. She later meets an imposing lady, Mrs. Quabarl, who mistakes her for a governess named Miss Hope. Lady Carlotta seems to go along with the mistake, and Mrs. Quabarl outlines her expectations for the children's education. Lady Carlotta then states she will speak French and Russian, even though no one else speaks Russian in the house, which takes Mrs. Quabarl aback. Lady Carlotta also seems unimpressed by Mrs. Quabarl's car which further upsets Mrs. Quabarl.

Thought:
Option A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job. - This doesn't seem accurate. Lady Carlotta does not seem concerned about the job or its aspects; she is going along with Mrs. Quabarl's mistaken assumption.

Topic: English
Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

  C: Question a suggestion - The paragraph is not centered around a suggestion.
  D: Analyze a reaction - The paragraph raises questions about Chie's potential reaction, but it does not analyze her reaction.

Criticism: 
  A: While the paragraph does discuss a particular cultural tradition, its primary focus is not to describe the culture as a whole but to raise questions about Chie's potential reaction.
  B: The paragraph is not necessarily criticizing the tradition but is instead questioning its potential impact on Chie's receptiveness.
  C: There is no particular suggestion made in the paragraph.
  D: The primary focus of the paragraph is to question the potential impact of Akira's decision to break traditions on Chie's receptiveness.

Response 1:
Knowledge:
  First Paragraph: "Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?"

Thought:
  The first paragraph describes Akira's actions going against tradition.
  It introduces the idea that Akira did not follow standard cultural practices to propose marriage.
  It questions whether Chie would have been more receptive if Akira had followed the traditional practices.

Criticism:
  The focus is on Akira's actions and their consequences, rather than analyzing a reaction or general description of a culture.
  
  Option A (describe a culture) is not the main purpose of the first paragraph, as it only mentions a single tradition rather than providing a broader description of a culture.
  
  Option B (criticize a tradition) is not the main purpose of the first paragraph either, as it doesn't directly criticize a tradition. It only raises the question of whether following the tradition would have resulted in a better outcome for Akira.
  
  Option C (question a suggestion) is the best fit for the main purpose of the paragraph. It raises a question regarding if following traditional practices would have made Chie more receptive.
  
  Option D (analyze a reaction) is not the primary focus of the first paragraph, as it does not delve into a detailed analysis of Chie's response.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph provides context for the setting and the situation. Akira comes directly, breaking the tradition of asking his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between for proposing a marriage. Chie wonders if she would have been more receptive if Akira had followed the tradition.

Thought:
  The first paragraph sets up the situational context and questions whether Chie's reaction would have been different if Akira had followed the tradition.

Criticism:
  There are no flaws in the facts or reasoning in understanding the main purpose of the first paragraph.

  C: Questioning a suggestion involves expressing doubt or seeking clarification about a proposed idea.
  D: Analyzing a reaction involves understanding and explaining why someone responded in a certain way.

Thought:
  The first paragraph talks about Akira breaking tradition by coming directly to Chie's house instead of using a go-between. This sets up the context in which the story takes place and introduces the question of whether things would have been different if Akira had followed the traditional approach.

Criticism: 
  The first paragraph helps the reader understand the context and the characters involved, and it focuses on the scenario that leads to Chie's reaction to Akira's unconventional approach.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph of the passage establishes the context of the story by briefly describing Akira's arrival or visit to Chie's house, and how it breaks tradition. It also wonders if following more formal protocols would have led to a more receptive attitude from Chie.

Thought: 
  The first paragraph serves as an introduction to the story's situation and context. It is not an in-depth analysis or criticism of tradition. While it does briefly question if following a more traditional approach might have resulted in a different outcome, the primary purpose is to describe the circumstances and set the stage for the events that follow.

Criticism:

- C: Questioning a suggestion means to express doubts or concerns regarding an idea or proposal.
- D: Analyzing a reaction means to carefully examine a response or behavior in a given situation.

Thought:
- The first paragraph introduces the fact that Akira broke tradition by directly approaching Chie about marriage and questions if this made Chie less receptive.
- It touches upon the customs and norms of their culture, but the main focus is the possible outcome of Akira's non-traditional approach.
- The primary purpose of the first paragraph is to question the result of Akira's actions, not solely to describe a culture, criticize a tradition, or analyze a reaction.

Action: Answer("C")

Among the given options, choice A is the closest to describing the purpose of the paragraph, as it indirectly discusses an aspect of the culture in question.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
The first paragraph of the text states:
"Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between-would Chie have been more receptive? He came on a winter's eve."

Thought:

Options:
A: Describe a culture: Although the first paragraph mentions a tradition, it mainly focuses on Akira's actions and raises a question. So, it doesn't primarily describe a culture.
B: Criticize a tradition: The paragraph raises a question related to the tradition, but it doesn't criticize the tradition.
C: Question a suggestion: The text doesn't present a suggestion, only a question about a hypothetical scenario.
D: Analyze a reaction: Although there is a mention of Chie's possible receptiveness, the emphasis of the paragraph is on the question raised, rather than analyzing her reaction.

Criticism:
After reviewing each option, option C doesn't seem to fit the purpose of the first paragraph well, as there isn't a direct suggestion, but rather a question being raised. The closest option is D: Analyze a reaction since the paragraph focuses on the question about Chie's possible receptiveness.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge: 
  The first paragraph sets the stage for the story and provides some context.
  A: Describing a culture means providing information on the beliefs, customs, and practices of a group of people.
  B: Criticizing a tradition means pointing out flaws or problems with a cultural practice.
  C: Questioning a suggestion means raising doubts or concerns about a proposed idea.
  D: Analyzing a reaction means examining someone's response to a situation or event.

Thought:
  In the first paragraph, Akira is breaking tradition by directly approaching Chie.
  This raises the question of if Akira had followed tradition, would Chie have been more receptive.
  It sets up a scenario where the reader wonders about Chie's possible reaction.

Criticism:
  The first paragraph does mention a tradition that Akira is breaking, but it does not criticize the tradition itself.
  It questions the potential outcome had Akira followed tradition, so it is not simply describing the culture nor analyzing a reaction.

If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,.but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the.doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The.poor market may be slowing innovation, but.advances continue; judging by the mood this week at.the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in.Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain.optimistic about its long-term prospects..The technology that’s surprised almost everyone.is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,.silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and.Martin Green, professor at the University of.New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar.panel researchers, declared that they’d never go.below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like 50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per.watt,” he says..The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of.reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar.panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020..Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target.even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the.direct cost of solar power to six cents per.kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost.expected for power from new natural gas power.plants..All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have.been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the.power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady.cost reductions. Green points to something as.mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of.the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar.cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon.solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To.achieve that record, he had to use expensive.lithography techniques to make fine wires for.collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual.improvements have made it possible to use screen.printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research.suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce.lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of.the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at.costs far lower than his lithography techniques..Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable.Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a.new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,.which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar.cell they made is the only current challenger to.silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film.cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower.the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power.cheaper..One of Green’s former students and colleagues,.Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer.China Sunergy, announced this week that he is.building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided.solar cell that can absorb light from both the front.and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that.during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the.land between rows of solar panels in a solar power.plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels.and could be harvested to increase the power output..This works particularly well when the solar panels.are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a.one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a.two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He.expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more.electricity over the course of a year..Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,.aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in.cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to.greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels.by combining silicon with one or two other.semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a.part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert.efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost.efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to.around 40 percent. Adding another could make.efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which.would cut in half the number of solar panels needed.for a given installation. The challenge is to produce.good connections between these semiconductors,.something made challenging by the arrangement of.silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.
Question: According to the passage, two-sided solar panels will likelyraise efficiency by

Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.
Question: In describing the relationship between Eppie and Silas, the narrator draws a connection between Eppie's
Choices:
  A: physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.
  B: expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.
  C: boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.
  D: physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality.

  The passage clearly draws a parallel between Eppie's expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life, so option B: expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life is the most accurate statement.

Action:
Answer("B")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  The passage is discussing the relationship between Eppie and Silas and how they affect each other's lives.

Analysis of Choices:
  A: Physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility - Although the passage does mention Silas's unfolding soul and enfeebled spirit, it doesn't explicitly connect these concepts with Eppie's physical vulnerability.
  B: Expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life - The passage discusses how Eppie's mind was growing into knowledge, and Silas's mind was growing into memory, and how Eppie's life and energy reawaken Silas's senses. As Eppie’s world grew, Silas’s world grew as well.
  C: Boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth - The passage mentions Silas's past obsession with gold, but it is not directly connected to Eppie's boundless energy. The passage rather presents a contrast between how the gold kept him focused on this singular object and how Eppie calls him away from his monotony with her zest for life.
  D: Physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality - The passage does not mention pain or mortality in the context of Silas's growth and relationship with Eppie.

Thought:
   The passage focuses primarily on the growth of Eppie's awareness and the ways that this growth affects Silas's engagement with life. The connection between Eppie's increasing knowledge and Silas's unfolding soul and reawakening senses is prominent. The passage does not focus on mortality or vulnerability, but rather on how Eppie helps Silas move away from his previous obsession with gold and towards a more profound and meaningful relationship with the world around them. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: Expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.

Criticism:
  By evaluating the passage and relating it to the provided choices, the decision to choose B seems logical and well-founded. The passage emphasizes the influence of Eppie's growth and expanding awareness on Silas's life, which aligns with the description provided in choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes the relationship between Eppie and Silas, as Eppie grows and develops in a world filled with life and sound.
  A: Physical vulnerability implies weakness or susceptibility, while emotional fragility refers to susceptibility to emotional distress.
  B: Expanding awareness refers to Eppie's growing understanding of the world around her, and increasing engagement with life relates to Silas becoming more involved in life as a result.
  C: Boundless energy refers to limitless enthusiasm or excitement, while insatiable desire for wealth means an unending pursuit of material wealth.
  D: Physical growth refers to Eppie's maturation, while painful perception of mortality implies that Silas feels distressed about his own impermanence.

Thought:
  The passage describes how Eppie's growth and development influences Silas's life, drawing him away from isolation and monotony (lines 22-30) and making him more engaged with the world around him. As Eppie's mind grows in knowledge and her world expands, so does Silas's mind grow in memory and his engagement in life (lines 56-58). This indicates a connection between Eppie's expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.

  Therefore, the best choice is B: expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.

Criticism:
  The passage does not focus on Eppie's physical vulnerability or Silas's emotional fragility (A), nor does it discuss Eppie's boundless energy being connected to Silas's insatiable desire for wealth (C). Additionally, it does not mention Eppie's physical growth connecting to Silas's perception of his own mortality (D). Therefore, the answer remains B.

Action: Answer("B")

Relevant knowledge:

- Silas was focused on material wealth (gold) before Eppie came into his life.

B: Expanding awareness and Silas' increasing engagement with life
- Eppie's growing mind leads to Silas growing into memory and a newfound engagement in life (e.g., engaging with nature, experiencing joy).

C: Boundless energy and Silas' insatiable desire for wealth
- Before Eppie, Silas focused on wealth, but the focus of the passage is how Eppie redirected that focus away from material wealth.

D: Physical growth and Silas' painful perception of his own mortality
- The passage doesn't mention any painful perception of Silas' mortality.

Thought process:
Option B seems most fitting, as Eppie's expanding awareness leads to Silas' increased engagement with life and experiences in the world, contrasting his previous focus on his loom and desire for gold.

Criticism:
The analysis appears accurate, as the passage demonstrates Eppie's positive influence on Silas' life and how she draws him out from his isolated existence.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.
Question: The narrator indicates that Claude, Wilfrid, Irene, and Viola are

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}That half the human race is excluded by the other half from any participation in government; that they are native by birth but foreign by law in the very land  where they were born; and that they areproperty-owners yet have no direct influence or representation: are all political phenomena apparently impossible to explain on abstract principle. But on another level of ideas, the question changes and may be easily resolved. The purpose ofall these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth. If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a 15 greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction.Any other ambition would be a reversal of our primary destinies; and it will never be in women's20 interest to change the assignment they have received.It seems to us incontestable that our common happiness, above all that of women, requires that they never aspire to the exercise of political rights and functions. Here we must seek their interests in25 the wishes of nature. Is it not apparent, that their delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the30 home? And is it not evident that the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a35 manner? This is sufficient; we need not invoke principles that are inapplicable to the question. Let us not make rivals of life's companions. You must, you truly must allow the persistence of a union that no interest, no rivalry, can possibly undo. Understand 40 that the good of all demands this of you.\section{Passage 2}Contending for the rights of woman, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of45 knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? unless freedom strengthen her50 reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an55 orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations....Consider, sir, dispassionately, these60 observations-for a glimpse of this truth seemed to open before you when you observed, "that to see one half of the human race excluded by the other from all participation of government, was a political phenomenon that, according to abstract principles, it65 was impossible to explain." If so, on what does your constitution rest? If the abstract rights of man will bear discussion and explanation, those of woman, by a parity of reasoning, will not shrink from the same test: though a different opinion prevails in this70 country, built on the very arguments which you use to justify the oppression of woman-prescription.Consider-I address you as a legislatorwhether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their75 own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift 80 of reason?In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination, from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be 85 useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you force all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark?

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: Which statement about striped cucumber beetles can most reasonably be inferred from the passage?

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four  down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France.A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie.45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68 , but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, "I didn't think you 70 were coming."Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.80 Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

  The first paragraph of the passage describes the Alcazar Restaurant, where it is located, its interior appearance, and Lymie sitting down to eat while using a history book for his reading. There is no mention of nightly habits, a specific date, or strong foreshadowing of an event.

Thought:
  A: Introduce the passage's main character by showing his nightly habits - the paragraph does not provide evidence about Lymie's nightly habits.

  D: No event is foreshadowed in the first paragraph, it focuses on description rather than a foreshadowing of what's to come.

The first paragraph tells us that The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue, describing how it was long and narrow, with tables for two and four. It also introduces Lymie, mentioning that he sits down and props a history book on the table while he orders his dinner. The book is characterized by marks like maps, drawings, dates, and cartoons. 

A: Introduces main character by showing nightly habits. The paragraph does introduce Lymie and gives us some idea of his habits, namely coming to the restaurant and reading a history book while eating. However, it doesn't state whether this routine occurs every night.

B: Indicate the date of the passage by presenting period details. Some details, like the art moderne decoration, allude to the approximate period, but it doesn't directly indicate the date in which the passage takes place.

C: Convey the passage's setting by describing a place and an object. The paragraph contains detailed information about the restaurant and decor, along with the history book, which gives us a sense of place and objects.

D: Foreshadow an event described in detail later in the passage. The paragraph doesn't provide information about any events that will be described later in the passage.

Though option A is somewhat accurate in suggesting that Lymie's nightly habits are portrayed, it doesn't introduce him as the main character. Instead, the first paragraph primarily focuses on setting the scene and describing the environment, which best aligns with option C.

Action: Answer("C")

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society
Question: Which argument does Parsons use to support her claim about the extent to which political parties can be trusted by voters?
Choices:

  D: Parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.
Response 0:

  Option B: The passage does not discuss political parties making deals with opposing parties in order to consolidate their power.
  
  Option C: The passage does mention that promises made by political parties while not in power do not necessarily reflect their actions when they come into power. They are more focused on maintaining power and silencing dissent.
  
  Option D: The passage does not discuss parties advancing positions that conflict with the beliefs of their members.

Criticism:
  Option A seems to align most closely with the argument presented in the passage, as it focuses on the human nature of political parties and their motivations for staying in power at all costs.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:

  C: The text mentions that parties promise things they may not deliver upon gaining power.
  D: The text does not discuss parties advancing positions at odds with their members' beliefs.

Action:
  Answer("A")
Response 2:

  A: Argument about corruption of human nature by power.
  B: Argument about parties making deals with opposing parties.

  D: Argument about parties advancing positions at odds with member beliefs.

Thought:
  In the passage, Parsons discusses her experience and understanding of governments and political parties, their tendencies to concentrate power, and the potential for abuse of power. She highlights the drawbacks of entrusting the management of society to finite humans. She also talks about the ambition and aspiration of politicians to remain in power, and their use of party machines for controlling opposition.

  A: In the passage, Parsons does mention that she realized "the faults, failings, shortcomings, aspirations, and ambitions of the fallible man" and that people in power tend to abuse it. This supports A's claim about power corrupting human nature.

  B: The passage does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties.

  C: The passage does discuss the idea that it does not matter what a party out of power may promise, as it can change once in power. However, this does not directly support the claim of parties always sacrificing their ideals for pragmatic actions.

  D: The passage does not mention parties advancing positions at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.

Criticism:
  Choice A seems to be most in line with the passage, as Parsons mentions the potential for abuse of power and the nature of politicians wanting to remain in power.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Relevant information from the passage:
- Parsons states that political parties out of power might make fair promises to gain people's trust, but once they are in power, they have the same human attributes as the politicians.

B: Parties often consolidate their power by making deals with opposing parties.
 - The passage doesn't mention making deals with opposing parties.

C: Political parties always sacrifice their own ideals for pragmatic actions.
 - The passage mentions parties prioritizing staying in power, but doesn't specifically say they sacrifice their own ideals.

D: Parties typically advance positions that are at odds with the beliefs of many of their members.
 - The passage doesn't specifically mention this as an argument for parties not being trusted.

Critically evaluating the information and choices, option A aligns best with Parsons' argument about the extent to which political parties can be trusted by voters.

Action: Answer("A")

Response 6:
Recall:
  The relevant passage discussing Parsons' claim about political parties and their trustworthiness is:
  "When I came to realize the faults, failings, shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the management of all its affairs, with all their manifold deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite man, to be managed by the party which happened to come into power, and therefore was the majority party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one particle of difference to me what a party out of power may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of [what] a party when entrenched and securely seated in power might do to crush opposition, and silence the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward step of progress."

Thought:
  Parsons states that one cannot trust political parties because when they gain power, they seek to maintain that power and crush opposition, silencing minority voices and potentially retarding progress.

This statement implies that political parties are not trustworthy because human nature is easily corrupted by power.

  B: The passage does not mention parties making deals with opposing parties.

  C: The passage does not specifically say that political parties always sacrifice their ideals, but implies that they prioritize power over their promises.

  D: The passage does not mention parties advancing positions against the beliefs of their members.
  
Criticism:

Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: As presented in the passage, Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on which type of evidence?
Choices:
  A: Direct observation
  B: Historical data
  C: Expert testimony
  D: Random sampling
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The passage describes a research study conducted by Theis and Adler on Texas gourd plants. They aimed to find out if a stronger fragrance would attract more pollinators or more beetles, both of which could have an effect on the plants' reproduction.
  
  A: Direct observation involves collecting data by observing subjects and their behaviors in their natural environment.
  B: Historical data is information collected from past events, records, or experiences.
  C: Expert testimony is the opinion of a person who has specialized knowledge or experience in a subject that is being discussed or examined.
  D: Random sampling is a statistical method that involves selecting a representative sample from a larger population to collect data or make inferences about the population.

Thought:
  The study involved Theis and Adler planting 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field. They made half the plants more fragrant by adding dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs to their flowers. They also removed beetles from half of the plants to see if that affected bee visits and pollination. They hand-pollinated half of the female flowers to serve as a benchmark for whether the fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles affected pollination.
  
  Theis and Adler worked at different hours to monitor the Texas gourd vines, observing the behavior of bees, beetles, and how the flowers were affected. They spent hours walking from flower to flower, observing each for two-minute intervals, and writing down their observations.
  
  It can be concluded that Theis and Adler's research primarily relied on direct observation based on how they monitored and recorded the behaviors of bees, beetles, and the effect on the flowers. Their data was collected directly from their observations, not relying on historical data, expert testimony, or random sampling.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.

Context: In 2000, a neuroscientist at University College London named Eleanor Maguire wanted to find out what effect, if any, all that driving around the  labyrinthine streets of London might have oncabbies' brains. When she brought sixteen taxi drivers into her lab and examined their brains in an MRI scanner, she found one surprising and important difference. The right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain known to beinvolved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger than normal in the cabbies-a small but very significant difference. Maguire concluded that all of that way-finding around London had physically altered the gross structure of their brains. The moreyears a cabbie had been on the road, the more pronounced the effect.The brain is a mutable organ, capable-within limits-of reorganizing itself and readapting to new kinds of sensory input, a phenomenon known asneuroplasticity. It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structurewas more or less static. Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.After her groundbreaking study of London cabbies, Maguire decided to turn her attention to mental athletes. She teamed up with ElizabethValentine and John Wilding, authors of the academic monograph Superior Memory, to study ten individuals who had finished near the top of the World Memory Championship. They wanted to find out if the memorizers' brains were-like the Londoncabbies'-structurally different from the rest of ours, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners  and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned. Maguire and her team thought it was possible that they might discover anatomical 45 differences in the brains of the memory champs, evidence that their brains had somehow reorganized themselves in the process of doing all that intensive remembering. But when the researchers reviewed the imaging data, not a single significant structural50 difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects. What's more, on every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes' scores came back well within the normal range. The 55 memory champs weren't smarter, and they didn't have special brains.But there was one telling difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects: When the researchers looked at which parts of the 60 brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry. According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be 65 working in overdrive for the mental athletes.Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial70 navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. At first glance, this wouldn't seem to make any sense. Why would mental athletes be conjuring images in 75 their mind's eye when they were trying to learn three-digit numbers? Why should they be navigating like London cabbies when they're supposed to be remembering the shapes of snowflakes?Maguire and her team asked the mental athletes 80 to describe exactly what was going through their minds as they memorized. The mental athletes said they were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial85 journeys. They weren't doing this automatically, or because it was an inborn talent they'd nurtured since childhood. Rather, the unexpected patterns of neural activity that Maguire's fMRIs turned up were the result of training and practice

Criticism:
There are no flaws in the facts or reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Recall:
- The passage states that mental athletes were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, and distributing those images along familiar spatial journeys.
- The fMRIs showed that mental athletes used different brain circuitry and regions associated with visual memory and spatial navigation, which were less active in control subjects.

Thought process:
- Option A suggests that mental athletes use parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization. Referring to the fMRIs, they activated different regions involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, which could indicate exploitation of parts of the brain less commonly engaged during memorization tasks. Option A seems plausible.
- Option B states that mental athletes convert information into abstract symbols. This is not supported by the passage, which explains they convert information into images and arrange them along spatial journeys. Option B is not accurate.
- Option C claims that mental athletes organize information into numerical lists, but the passage does not mention such a strategy. It describes the use of images and spatial journeys for memorization. Option C is not supported.
- Option D posits that mental athletes exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and challenges. While they likely practice their craft, the passage does not mention puzzles or challenges as a specific method for success. The focus is on using images and spatial journeys, so Option D is not the best answer.

Critically evaluate:
- Option A is directly supported by the passage, as it refers to the different brain areas mental athletes use when memorizing. The other options do not offer accurate or specific strategies discussed in the passage. Thus, Option A is the best answer.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

A: A general discussion of the narrator's love of reading is covered in the beginning, and shifts later to a portrayal of an influential incident (the gift of "Great Expectations" by the bookseller)
B: The passage does depict the narrator's father and his disapproval of reading, but it does not focus primarily on an examination of Charles Dickens as an author. It focuses more on the narrator's experience with Dickens' novel "Great Expectations."
C: The passage does not have a symbolic representation of a skill that the narrator possesses, but it talks about his love of reading and experiences associated with it.
D: The passage briefly mentions the hardships of the narrator's childhood, but it is not a primary focus, and the analysis of the effects of those hardships is not the central theme.

Thought:
The passage begins with a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading and how he would secretly read against his father's wishes. It shifts to a specific influential incident when the bookseller gifts him "Great Expectations," which captures his imagination and solidifies his love for reading.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.
Question: The studies in the passage suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would
Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.
  B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.
  C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Response 0:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses research findings that suggest smaller brands see consumer support increase when they're faced with a competitive threat from large brands. 
  A field study was conducted in an independent bookstore, with shoppers being exposed to in-store ads emphasizing either the store's large competitors, small competitors, or no competition.
  Shoppers who read the "large competitors" version of the in-store ad showed a higher likelihood of making a purchase, purchasing more items, and spending more money in the store than those who read the "small competitors" or "no competition" versions.
  In other studies, support for a large brand decreased when consumers viewed it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
  
Thought: 
  The question asks what would likely happen if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors.
  Based on the passage, support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
  If customers at a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, they would likely perceive the large store as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  Therefore, the reasoning suggests that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

Criticism:
  The facts, logic, and reasoning appear consistent with the passage. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Relevant information from the passage:
  - In six lab and field studies, highlighting a large competitor’s size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them. Small brands see consumer support go up when they are faced with a competitive threat from large brands.
  - Support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
  - Shoppers were significantly more likely to make a purchase after reading the “large competitors” version of the in-store ad, compared to the “small competitors” version or the “no competition” version.

Thoughts:
  Given the information in the passage, it is unlikely that the large chain bookstore would receive more positive reviews (A) or gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops (B) if customers were given information about small competitors. C is not likely either since people's perception that its competition is even greater does not seem relevant based on the passage.

  Answer D aligns with the findings discussed in the passage. If customers of the large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, they might see the large store as a competitor of the smaller shops, potentially causing the large store to lose customers who prefer to support smaller businesses.

Criticism:
  The provided information and thoughts seem valid, and the conclusion reached is consistent with the studies discussed in the passage. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses how smaller brands can benefit when consumers see the competitive threat they face from larger organizations.
- The field study at an independent bookstore showed that emphasizing the competition from large corporations resulted in shoppers being more likely to make purchases.
- Other studies have found that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

Thought:
- Based on the information, we can deduce the possible effects of customers of a large chain bookstore being given information focusing on the store's small competitors.
- If the large store emphasizes its small competitors, customers may view it as competing with smaller shops. This could lead to a decrease in support for the large brand, as shown in the studies mentioned in the passage.

Criticism:
- The reasoning seems logically consistent, and the information from the passage supports the conclusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
- The passage discusses how smaller brands can benefit from competing with larger brands if consumers notice the competitive threat.
- The field study in the independent bookstore demonstrated that people would support a smaller brand more when competing against large competitors.

Thought:
- If customers of a large chain bookstore are given information focusing on the store's small competitors, it would mean that customers are now viewing the large store in direct competition with smaller businesses.

Criticism:
- None needed, as the thought process aligned itself with the knowledge from the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
The passage discusses how smaller brands can benefit when customers see the competitive threat they face from larger organizations.
The field study at an independent bookstore shows that shoppers were more likely to make a purchase and spent more money at the store when they read about the large competitors.
Subsequent studies show that support for a large brand decreases when customers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

Thought:
We need to find the likely result for a large chain bookstore given information about its small competitors.
A: Refers to positive reviews, which are not mentioned regarding large stores in competition with small others in the passage.
B: Stored offering more choices isn't discussed.
C: The perception of greater competition is not discussed in relation to the large store itself.
D: The passage states that "support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand." So D aligns with this finding.

Criticism:
The information presented in the passage primarily focuses on the positive effects for small brands when viewed in competition with larger ones. While it does say support for a large brand decreases in competition with a smaller brand, it doesn't explicitly mention every detail provided in answer choices A, B, and C. Nonetheless, choice D is the closest to the findings stated in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  - The passage discusses research on how small companies can benefit if consumers see them facing a competitive threat from larger organizations.
  - An experiment in the passage had three versions of in-store ads (emphasizing large competitors, small competitors, or no competition) at an independent bookstore.
  - Shoppers were more likely to make a purchase after reading the "large competitors" version of the in-store ad, compared to the "small competitors" or "no competition" versions.
  - Support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

Thought:
  - The passage suggests consumers prefer to support smaller brands when they are faced with a competitive threat from large brands.
  - If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, it would make them see the large store as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  - This would likely lead to a shift of support towards the smaller companies.

  - The thought process is based on the facts and experiments stated in the passage.
  - The conclusion drawn aligns with the results of the research presented in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- The passage is about the effects of competition between small and large businesses on consumer support.
- In the field study at the independent bookstore, shoppers who read the "large competitors" ad version were:

    - More likely to make a purchase
    - Purchased more items
    - Spent more money at the store

- In lab studies involving an independent bookstore and large corporations, it was observed that consumers tend to support small brands when they face a competitive threat from large brands.
- When consumers perceive large brands to be in competition with smaller brands, support for the large brand decreases.
  
Thought:
- The question asks what would happen if the customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors.
- Drawing from the passage, consumers tend to support small brands when they face a competitive threat from large brands.
- If the large store is emphasizing its small competitors, it risks losing consumer support, as people may choose to support the smaller shops.
- Therefore, the large store would likely lose customers who view it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

- Results showed that shoppers were significantly more likely to make a purchase, buy more items, and spend more money at the store when the ad emphasized large competitors.

Thought:
- If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, it would be similar to the experiment conducted for the small bookstore where the ad emphasized small competitors.
- The small bookstore experiment showed that focusing on small competitors did not lead to higher consumer support or purchases.

Criticism:
- The conclusion drawn from the passage is reasonable and well-supported by the provided information and experiment results.

Thought:
- The question asks about the likely result if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors. Based on the passage, this scenario would likely cause the large store to lose customer support.
- Option A: The passage does not mention the impact on customer reviews specifically for the large competitor.
- Option B: This is not mentioned or implied in the passage, as it is focused on the benefits for the small competitors when their competition with large brands is highlighted.
- Option C: The passage does not say the large store would benefit from people's perception that its competition is greater; it actually implies the opposite and focuses on the benefits for smaller brands.
- Option D: The passage suggests that large stores would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops, as support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together, to a house divided against itself, and says that it is  contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.When did he learn, and by what authority does he proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that "a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand." Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a "house divided against itself." They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
Question: 80 with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there has been agitation and resistance.... Do you think that the nature of man will be changed, that the same 85 causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same effect at another? In the first paragraph of Passage 1, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to
Choices:
  A: provide context for Douglas's defense of continued expansion.
  B: suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
  C: imply that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country.

- C: Implying that Lincoln is unaware of basic facts concerning the country is a possible rhetorical strategy that Douglas might use.  
- D: Accounting for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable may support Douglas's argument regarding the Union's strength and growth.

Thought:
- In the first paragraph of Passage 1, Douglas talks about the expansion of the United States in terms of territory, population, wealth, and power.
- He argues that this growth happened under a divided Union, and therefore, the Union's existence wasn't threatened by the division of free and slave states.
- He uses this argument to criticize Lincoln's assertion that the government is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand in such division.
- The main purpose of this discussion is to prove that despite the division into free and slave states, the United States has experienced significant growth and expansion.
- Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population is to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.

Criticism:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: Which statement best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research?
Choices:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.
Response 0:
Recap:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This statement refers to the idea that understanding how modern birds learn to fly could provide insights into the evolutionary development of flight.
  
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior. This statement touches on the observation of young birds jumping up like popcorn but doesn't directly relate to the central assumption behind Ken Dial's research.
  
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest. This statement refers to the rancher's observation about putting the birds in a more natural setting with places to perch. However, it does not capture the central assumption of Dial's research.
  
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel. This statement suggests that two types of evolutionary predecessors of birds developed simultaneously. It does not directly relate to Ken Dial's central assumption for his research.

Thought:
  The primary focus of Ken Dial's research is to uncover insights about how baby game birds learn to fly, with the potential of shedding light on the evolutionary acquisition of flight. Statement A aligns with this goal by connecting the flight behavior of young birds to their evolutionary ancestors.

Criticism:
  The provided recap and thought analysis reasonably support the idea that statement A is the best representation of Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses Ken Dial's research on the development of flight in young birds.
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors - The passage explores the evolutionary significance and practical applications of WAIR, as well as the development of flight in young birds.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior - In the passage, Ken Dial observed that young ground birds jumped and flapped their half-formed wings, but the evolutionary relevance of this behavior is not emphasized.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest - In the passage, it is mentioned that young birds in both laboratory and natural settings prefer elevated perches for resting.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel - This statement does not seem to relate directly to Ken Dial's research assumptions and is not mentioned in the passage.

Thought:
  Ken Dial's research aims to understand the development of flight in young birds and its evolutionary significance, particularly using the Chukar Partridge as a model species. He focuses on the use of WAIR and its connection to the development of flight in both young and adult birds, as well as in their evolutionary ancestors. Based on the information in the passage, it appears that statement A best captures Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.

Criticism:
  The passage does not provide any indication that the tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically (statement B) is a recent evolved behavior. Likewise, the passage does not support the idea that young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely to require perches when at rest (statement C). There is also no mention of ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolving in parallel (statement D) as part of Ken Dial's research assumptions. Therefore, statement A remains the most accurate choice.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Relevant information:
  Ken Dial observed young ground birds following parents and flapping their half-formed wings.
  He designed a project to study clues in how baby game birds learned to fly.
  The Chukar Partridge was chosen as a model species.
  After the suggestion of a rancher, Ken introduced perches for the Chukars and observed their behavior.
  He discovered wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) and documented it in various species.
  WAIR suggests a viable origin for flapping flight stroke and aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
  
Thought process:
  Ken's research is focused on understanding the development of flight in young birds and the implications on evolutionary ancestors. His initial assumption is that by studying the acquisition of flight in young birds, he can potentially learn about how flight evolved in their ancestors.
  
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This statement reflects Ken's central assumption and research goal.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior. This statement is about a behavior and not directly related to Ken's central assumption about flight acquisition.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest. This statement is a detail, not a central assumption.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel. This statement is not directly related to Ken's central assumption and research goal.

  - C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest. This choice is not related to the main assumption of the experiment.
  - D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel. The passage doesn't discuss the parallel evolution of ground-dwelling and tree-climbing birds.

Criticism:
  - Choice A is the most related to Ken Dial's central assumption, as his research is focused on understanding the acquisition of flight behavior in young birds to gain insight into the evolutionary ancestors.
  - Choices B, C, and D are not directly related to the central assumption of the research.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
  A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This statement refers to using the development of flight in birds as a model to understand the evolution of flight in their ancestral species.
  B: The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior. This statement refers to the idea that hopping or jumping in young birds is a recently evolved behavior rather than an ancestral one.
  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest. This statement discusses differences in behavior between birds in controlled settings versus those in the wild.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel. This statement refers to the idea that the ancestors of modern birds evolved on separate evolutionary paths, with some species remaining ground-dwelling and others developing the ability to climb trees.

Thought:
  Based on the passage, Ken Dial is researching baby game birds learning to fly, particularly the Chukar Partridge.
  The passage discusses the rancher's advice to provide the birds with something to climb on since they are naturally inclined to perch on elevated surfaces.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the  countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between 5 the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people that $\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or give me death," he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being
Choices:
  A: unrealistic, since most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
  B: deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government.
  C: impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
  D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans
Response 0:
Knowledge:
- In Passage 1, Beveridge discusses the growth and expansion of America, and the potential benefits of extending American laws and values to other territories, including Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippines.
- In Passage 2, Bryan questions the legitimacy of American imperialism and points out that people in colonized territories would not willingly surrender their own autonomy.
- A: Unrealistic refers to something that is not practical, achievable, or feasible.
- B: Deceptive refers to something that is intentionally misleading or false.
- C: Impractical refers to something that is not sensible or reasonable in the given situation.
- D: Naïve refers to a lack of understanding or experience, or showing a lack of judgment regarding a situation or circumstance.

Thought:
- Bryan critiques American imperialism and argues that people would not want to be governed by a foreign power.
- Therefore, Bryan would likely criticize Beveridge's vision as unrealistic because many people would not want to be governed by Americans.
- The answer is A: unrealistic, since most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.

Criticism:
- Passage 2 criticizes the idea of American governance over the island territories, focusing on the objection of islanders, not Americans.
- A better assessment should be made in relation to why Bryan thinks it's naive to assume the islanders would accept American governance.

Correct reasoning:
- Bryan's main criticism in Passage 2 is that the islanders would object to American governance and resist their rule.
- This aligns with the idea of being naive, which indicates a lack of understanding concerning the islanders' response to American governance.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge: 
Passage 1 by Beveridge presents a vision of American governance on island territories that portrays the expansion as beneficial for both Americans and the people living on the islands. It envisions American laws bringing justice and safety to these territories and contributing to the development of a prosperous civilization. 

Passage 2 by Bryan discusses the idea of the United States holding the Philippine Islands permanently and criticizes the policy, as it believes subject races will protest against the policy and resist. Bryan also argues against the idea of American governance on island territories, citing the nation's historical struggle for liberty and the natural desire for self-government.

A: There's no direct mention in Passage 2 of Americans being unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
B: Passage 2 by Bryan does not focus on economic domination as the true goal of American government.
C: There's no indication in Passage 2 that islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
D: In Passage 2, Bryan suggests that subject races would protest against the policy and resist, implying that the vision in Passage 1 might not consider the objections of the islanders being governed by Americans.

Thought:
Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1. The most suitable reason among the choices given is D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans due to the natural desire for self-government and historical examples mentioned by Bryan in Passage 2.

- He believes that American laws covering these islands will bring justice and safety and thus attract Americans to live and prosper in those places.

Information from Passage 2:
- Bryan disagrees with the Republican party's idea of holding the Philippine Islands and governing the colonies, similar to European empires.
- He argues that the subject races (islanders) will protest against this policy and resist to the extent possible.
- The passage mentions figures like Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln, who have all spoken in defense of liberty and popular government in the past.

Considering this information, the most reasonable inference regarding Bryan's criticism of Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is:

A: Not supported by the passages. The passages don't mention Americans' willingness or unwillingness to relocate.

B: Not directly supported by these passages. Bryan doesn't explicitly argue that economic domination would be the true goal; his focus is on the opposition that islanders would show due to their desire for self-governance.

C: Not supported by the passages. Equal distribution of resources is not a concern Bryan brings up.

D: This choice aligns with the information in Passage 2. Bryan believes that islanders would object to being governed by Americans. He uses examples from American history in which self-governance and liberty were championed against foreign rule.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Recap of Passage 1:
- Beveridge presents a vision of American governance in island territories that includes a positive view of Americans relocating, improving conditions, and ultimately welcoming those territories under the American flag.

Recap of Passage 2:
- Bryan argues that the love of liberty is inherently present in all people, and that pursuing a policy of imperialism would be detrimental to both the subjected peoples and the principles of self-government in the United States.

Analysis of Choices:
A: There isn't enough information in the passages to conclude that Bryan would find Beveridge's vision unrealistic due to a lack of American willingness to relocate.
B: Bryan doesn't directly accuse Beveridge's vision of being deceptive, but his focus on the desire for liberty and the problematic nature of imperialism implies that he might question the true goals of imperialist policies.
C: The issue of resource distribution isn't mentioned in either passage, so it's unlikely that Bryan would criticize the vision for being impractical based on that aspect.
D: Bryan's emphasis on the inherent love of liberty and the potential negative effects of imperialist policies suggest that he would find Beveridge's vision naive because the islanders would likely resist American governance.

Criticism:
The analysis is consistent with the information and arguments provided in the passages. Choice D is the most reasonable inference from Bryan's arguments in Passage 2 in relation to Beveridge's vision in Passage 1.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1: Beveridge presents a vision of American governance of island territories, where Americans are bringing energy, industry, justice, and safety.
  Passage 2: Bryan mentions that the Republican party should state its position and defend it, but expect subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist. He also talks about the love of liberty in every human heart and how no one would welcome a foreign master.

Thoughts:
  Comparing both passages, we can see that Bryan disagrees with the vision of American governance presented by Beveridge. Based on the available choices, we need to identify the reason Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision.
  
  A: Unrealistic - There's nothing in Passage 2 indicating that Bryan would think most Americans would be unwilling to relocate to distant islands.
  B: Deceptive - Although not explicitly mentioned, this might be a possible reason, as Bryan speaks about the resistance of subject races and the principle of self-government.
  C: Impractical - Passage 2 does not mention anything about equal distribution of resources. 
  D: Naive - Bryan talks about the love of liberty and how no one would welcome a foreign master, which indicates that he thinks the idea of American governance in island territories is naive because islanders would object to being governed by Americans.

Criticism:
  Comparing both passages, Bryan seems to criticize Beveridge's vision mainly because of the love of liberty and the expectation of resistance from the subject races. Choice D appears to be the most reasonable inference. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
  Passage 1 discusses the potential for American expansion and influence in territories such as Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and Cuba. Beveridge seems to support American governance and the implementation of safety in these territories.
  Passage 2 is from William Jennings Bryan, who argues against imperialism and emphasizes the love of liberty in every human heart. He discusses the negative effects of imperialism on both the subject races and on the principle of self-government in the United States.

Choices analysis:
  A: There is no mention of Americans being unwilling to relocate to distant islands in Passage 2.
  B: Passage 2 is more focused on the principle of self-government and the love of liberty rather than economic domination.
  C: Passage 2 does not discuss the equal distribution of resources as the primary issue with American governance of island territories.
  D: Passage 2 emphasizes the objection of the islanders to being governed by Americans and the love of liberty in every human heart, suggesting that Bryan would see the vision in Passage 1 as naive.

Thought:
  Bryan's criticism in Passage 2 is based on the love of liberty and the negative effects of imperialism on both subject races and the principle of self-government in the United States. He implies that islanders would not welcome foreign governance.
  Choice D matches this criticism, as it suggests that islanders would object to being governed by Americans.

Criticism:
  The analysis seems correct, as Passage 2 focuses on the principles of self-government and the love of liberty, and choice D reflects Bryan's concerns about the islanders' objection to being governed by Americans.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 discusses the expansion of the United States, highlighting the potential for growth and prosperity in Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and Cuba. The author takes a positive view on the idea of American governance in these territories.

  Passage 2 mentions that it's not right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies. It also states that Filipinos and other subjects do not need encouragement from Americans to resist foreign domination, and that the love of liberty exists in every human heart.

Thought:
  Analyzing the answer choices in context to both passages, we can make the following evaluations:
  
  A: While Passage 1 does mention Americans moving to these territories, Passage 2 does not directly address this aspect. So, the answer can't be A.

  B: Passage 2 does not necessarily talk about economic domination being the true goal of the American government; it focuses more on the principle of self-government and foreign domination. So, the answer can't be B.
  
  C: Passage 2 does not discuss the equal distribution of resources; it mainly focuses on the principle of self-government and resistance to foreign domination. So, the answer can't be C.

  D: Passage 2 highlights the resistance that islanders might have towards being governed by Americans due to the inherent love of liberty in every human heart. Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision, as outlined in Passage 1, for not acknowledging this resistance. The answer is D.

Criticism:
  There doesn't seem to be any flaws in the facts, logic, and reasoning of the answer. Comparing the context of both passages and the relevance of each answer choice, it can be concluded that choice D is the correct one.

Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: The main purpose of the passage is to
Choices:
  A: contrast the tool-using behavior of wild and captive-raised woodpecker finches.
  B: describe experiments intended to clarify the benefits of tool use for woodpecker finches.

  The passage presents an experimental study on the woodpecker finches' tool use and whether it is acquired socially.
  The study found that social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of tool-using behavior in woodpecker finches, but a strong genetic predisposition was determined.
  The passage also includes comparisons to primates and New Caledonian crows but focuses mainly on the woodpecker finches and the role of genetic predisposition and individual learning in the development of their tool use.

Criticism:
  The passage does make some comparisons with primates and New Caledonian crows, but its primary focus is on the development of tool-using behavior in woodpecker finches.
  The emphasis is given to the experimental study and its results in explaining the development of tool use in woodpecker finches, not on contrasting with wild and captive-raised birds or discussing the benefits of tool use.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses an experimental study which investigates how tool use is learned by woodpecker finches and compares their tool-using behavior to other species such as primates and New Caledonian crows. It explains the role of social learning, genetic components, and individual learning in the development of tool-using behavior.

A: This choice focuses on contrasting wild and captive-raised woodpecker finches, but the passage's focus is on the development of tool-using behavior in general, not specifically on wild vs. captive-raised finches.
  
B: This choice emphasizes the benefits of tool use for woodpecker finches. While the benefits of tool use are mentioned, it is not the main purpose of the passage.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.The brains of humans are conspicuously larger than the.brains of other apes, but the human-specific genetic.factors responsible for the uniquely large human.neocortex remain obscure. Since humans split from.chimps, which have brains roughly a third of human size,.the human genome has undergone roughly 15 million.changes. Which of these genetic tweaks could have led to.big brains?.About six years ago, scientists in David Haussler’s lab at.Howard Hughes Medical Institute discovered a gene called.NOTCH2NL. It’s a relative of NOTCH2, a gene that.scientists knew was central to early brain development..NOTCH2 controls vital decisions regarding when and how.many neurons to make..When the Haussler team looked in the official version.of the human genome at that time^1 —version 37—.NOTCH2NL appeared to be located in chromosome 1.near a region linked to abnormal brain size. Delete a hunk.of the region, and brains tend to shrink. Duplicate part of.it, and brains tend to overgrow..“We thought, ‘Oh, this is incredible,’” Haussler said..NOTCH2NL seemed to check all the boxes for a key role.in human brain development. But when the team mapped.NOTCH2NL’s precise location in the genome, they.discovered the gene wasn’t actually in the relevant.chromosomal region after all; the once-promising.candidate seemed to be a dud..“We were downhearted,” Haussler recalled. That all.changed with the next official version of the human.genome—version 38. In this iteration, NOTCH2NL was.located in the crucial region. “And there were three.versions of it,” Haussler exclaimed. Over the last three.million years, his team calculated, NOTCH2NL was.repeatedly copy-pasted into the genome, what he calls “a.series of genetic accidents.”.Genetic analysis of several primate species revealed that.the three genes exist only in humans and their recent.relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans, not in.chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans. What’s more, the.timing of these genes’ emergence matches up with the.period in the fossil record when our ancestors’ craniums.began to enlarge, Haussler points out. Together, the results.suggest that NOTCH2NL genes played a role in beefing.up human brain size..Passage 2.Modern humans have brains that are more than three.times larger than our closest living relatives,.chimpanzees and bonobos. Scientists don’t agree on.when and how this dramatic increase took place, but.new analysis of 94 hominin fossils shows that average.brain size increased gradually and consistently over the.past three million years..The research, published in The Proceedings of the.Royal Society B, shows that the trend was caused.primarily by evolution of larger brains within.populations of individual species, but the introduction of.new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones also played a part..“Brain size is one of the most obvious traits that.makes us human. It’s related to cultural complexity,.language, tool making and all these other things that.make us unique,” said Andrew Du, PhD, a postdoctoral.scholar at the University of Chicago and first author of.the study. “The earliest hominins had brain sizes like.chimpanzees, and they have increased dramatically since.then. So, it’s important to understand how we got here.”.Du and his colleagues compared published research.data on the skull volumes of 94 fossil specimens from 13.different species, beginning with the earliest.unambiguous human ancestors, Australopithecus, from 3.2 million years ago to pre-modern species, including.Homo erectus, from 500,000 years ago when brain size.began to overlap with that of modern-day humans..The researchers saw that when the species were.counted at the clade level, or groups descending from a.common ancestor, the average brain size increased.gradually over three million years. Looking more closely,.the increase was driven by three different factors,.primarily evolution of larger brain sizes within.individual species populations, but also by the addition.of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-.brained ones..The study quantifies for the first time when and by.how much each of these factors contributes to the clade-.level pattern. Du said he likens it to how a football coach.might build a roster of bigger, strong players. One way.would be to make all the players hit the weight room to.bulk up. But the coach could also recruit new, larger.players and cut the smallest ones..(^1) The reference version of the human genome goes through updates to.more completely map out each chromosomal sequence.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Passage 1.After years of hard work by conservationists.throughout Asia, a new study brings good news for.the world’s wild tigers. According to a new report by.the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of.tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising.over the last several years. If continued surveys prove.this to be true, this would mark the first time in more.than a century that tiger populations have grown..In a study compiling surveys taken across Asia,.researchers at the WWF found that there are at least 3,890 tigers living in the wild today—a considerable.increase from the 3,200 recorded in 2010. The study.suggests that the commitment to and success of.conservation programs in some countries have.contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger.population..“It’s a positive trend,” Ginette Hemley, the WWF’s.senior vice president of wildlife conservation, says..“We’re cautiously hopeful.”.Counting wild tigers, however, isn’t easy. While.tens of thousands of tigers once roamed Asia from.Turkey to Indonesia, their habitats have become tiny.and scattered during the last century. Wild tigers are.notoriously elusive, preferring to hide out in hard-to-.reach places in jungle undergrowth and high.mountains..Combined with their low numbers, these factors.can make them difficult to keep track of, which can.leave some uncertainty as to whether the populations.are truly on the rise. The increased numbers may in.part reflect better surveying methods..Additionally, while the global number of wild.tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country.analysis is more sobering. Though several countries.including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have.gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers.disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss..Passage 2.Photographic capture-recapture and large-scale.occupancy modeling are now used to estimate tiger.numbers and range in several countries across Asia..(Scientists who study other elusive carnivores with.unique body markings, including African wild dogs.and wolverines, are also employing these approaches.).Yet on the whole, although the science of tiger.population assessment has rapidly progressed, its.adoption by governmental and nongovernmental.conservation agencies has not, whether because of a.lack of understanding of or comfort with the new.methods or because the old methods cast a more.flattering light on their efforts..A recent example illustrates just how insidious.reliance on outdated tools is. In April the WWF and.the Global Tiger Forum announced to great fanfare.that the planet’s wild tiger population was at last on.the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals. These groups.aim to increase the number of tigers to 6,000 by 2022..But their tally, based on official estimates, relied on.flawed methodologies, including the use of.statistically weak extrapolations from tiger.photographs and field counts of spoor.^1 And their.goal for population growth far exceeds what one.would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried.out using more rigorous techniques. Furthermore,.apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in.India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing.data to show that populations are recovering in the.rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. Indeed, countries.such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their.viable tiger populations in recent years—losses.masked by any single global tiger number..Speculative tiger numbers for countries and.regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting.conservationists and the public from what should be.our top priority: guarding and growing the source.populations.^2 In a way, the overall number of wild.tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not.matter. The source populations are the ones we need.to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available.to track their numbers. Only with reliable counts can.we set realistic goals for future growth, develop.suitable strategies for meeting those goals and.measure the impact of our conservation efforts..(^1) Animal droppings.(^2) Animals located in areas with suitable conditions for reproduction.to take place.History shows that scientific progress can stall.from lack of understanding, institutional inertia and.political considerations for decades or even centuries..But as the world enters into the sixth mass extinction.of wild species, we simply cannot afford to divorce.conservation practices from sound science if we are to.have any hope of saving a wildlife icon like the.majestic tiger.
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passages that their authors would both agree that wild tiger population sizes are
Choices:
  A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.
  B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010.
  C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts.
  D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention.
Response 0:
Analysis:
Passage 1 mentions that the number of wild tigers may be slowly rising, and some countries like India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia have seen an increase in their tiger populations, while others face tiger population decline due to poaching and habitat loss. Passage 2 criticizes WWF's reporting and methodologies for calculating tiger population but acknowledges that some countries, like India and parts of Thailand, have seen an increase in their tiger populations.

A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others - This statement is in line with both passages, which discuss some countries showing positive tiger population growth and others with continued decline.

B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010 - This statement is not supported, as it's only mentioned that there may be a general increase in wild tiger populations but there's no specific mention of returning to 2010 levels.

C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts - This statement is not supported by both passages, as neither claims predictability in the response to conservation efforts.

D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention - This statement is also not supported by both passages, as they highlight some regions where tiger populations have increased.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, both authors would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1 mentions that the number of wild tigers may be rising slowly over the last several years, but also states that country-by-country analysis shows mixed results, with some countries seeing an increase in tiger population, while others are losing tigers due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methodologies used in the WWF's report and argues that focusing on the overall global number of tigers is not helpful for conservation efforts. It mentions that there are no convincing data to show populations recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia, and that countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost viable tiger populations in recent years.

Thought:
  Both passages agree that wild tiger population sizes are showing mixed results across different countries. Some countries are experiencing an increase in population, while others are losing tigers due to various factors. This is in line with choice A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

Criticism:
  The thought process appears accurate, identifying the common point in both passages about the variation in wild tiger population recovery across different countries.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Knowledge: 
Passage 1 suggests that tiger populations may be increasing due to conservation efforts in some countries, although it also acknowledges that the increased numbers may be due to better survey methods and some countries are still losing tigers due to poaching and habitat loss.
Passage 2 argues that the reported increase in the global wild tiger population is based on flawed methodologies and focuses on the importance of monitoring the source populations using the best science available, instead of relying on a single global tiger number.

Thought:
A: Both passages mention countries where the tiger populations are increasing (India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia) and others where viable tiger populations are lost (e.g. Cambodia, Vietnam, and China), suggesting that recovery is indeed more full in certain countries.
B: Neither passage specifically talks about returning to levels recorded in 2010. In fact, they do not mention 2010 as a benchmark year.
C: Passage 1 briefly mentions that conservation programs in some countries might have contributed to population growth, while passage 2 mostly criticizes unreliable methodologies used by conservationists to estimate the tiger population size and growth.
D: The passages do not state that wild tiger populations are declining steadily despite human intervention, but rather that recovery might not be as optimistic as presented by some sources.

Criticism:
The most reasonable inference based on both passages is that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
  Passage 1:
    - WWF report showed an increase in wild tiger numbers (3,890 in this study compared to 3,200 in 2010)
    - Ginsel Hemley cautiously hopeful about the positive trend
    - Global tiger number increases but country-wise analysis shows some countries still face declining numbers due to poaching and habitat loss
  Passage 2:
    - WWF and Global Tiger Forum were criticized for using flawed methodologies in estimating tiger populations
    - No convincing data that tiger populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia
    - Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years
    - The overall number of wild tigers may not matter as much as tracking source populations using the best science available
Thought:
  A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others - Both passages mention that some countries have seen an increase in tiger populations while others have not.
  B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010 - Both passages suggest that tiger populations have increased but do not mention returning to 2010 levels.
  C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts - While both passages acknowledge conservation efforts, they do not imply that tiger populations are responding predictably to them.
  D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention - Both passages acknowledge declines in some countries, but they do not agree that the overall trend is a steady decline.
Criticism:
  - Comparing the points made in the passages, it appears that A is the best answer, as both authors agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in some countries compared to others.
  - Remaining answer choices do not accurately capture the authors' agreement.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Passage 1:
- "The number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years."
- "The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population."
- "Though several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan and Russia may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss."

Passage 2:
- "Apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia."
- "Indeed, countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years—losses masked by any single global tiger number."

Thought:
Both passages mention that wild tiger populations have increased in some countries (like India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia, and parts of Thailand) but not in others (such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China) and that there might be different factors affecting these populations, including conservation efforts.

Answer:
Based on the information from both passages, it seems that the authors would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others. Therefore, the correct answer is A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought Process:
- Passage 1 states that the number of wild tigers has been slowly rising over the last several years, and while India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have seen an increase in tigers, others have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
- Passage 2 explains that despite the announcement of tiger population growth, there are no convincing data showing that the populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia. It also mentions that countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations.

Answer analysis:
  A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others - Both passages mention that tiger population increases are seen in specific countries (India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia) while others experience declines. This option is supported by both passages.
  B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010 - Both passages state that the current population is higher than the 2010 levels and do not mention that the population is returning to the 2010 levels.
  C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts - Neither passage explicitly or even implicitly mentions predictable response to aggressive conservation attempts.
  D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention - Both passages mention that tigers are disappearing in some areas due to various factors. However, this option does not encompass the fact that some countries have successfully increased their tiger populations.

Considering the information provided in both passages, the authors would likely agree with option A. The passages indicate that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Knowledge:
- Both passages mention the improvement of wild tiger populations.
- Passage 1 states that the number of wild tigers in some countries has increased (India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia), while others have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
- Passage 2 suggests a focus on guarding and growing the source populations to conserve wild tigers. It also mentions that some countries have lost viable tiger populations, while other areas show population recovery.

Thought:
- In both passages, the wild tiger population is presented as recovering in some countries but disappearing in others.
- Therefore, the best answer choice must reflect the differing levels of recovery between countries.

Criticism:
- The analysis of both passages appears accurate and supports the chosen answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
Passage 1 suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the past few years, marking the first time in over a century that tiger populations have grown. The study mentioned in the passage states that conservation programs in some countries have contributed to this growth. However, the passage also acknowledges that while the global number of wild tigers appears to have increased, a country-by-country analysis shows that several countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.

Passage 2, although critical of the methodologies used to track tiger populations, doesn't deny that there might be some growing populations in certain places such as India and parts of Thailand. This passage also confirms that tiger populations in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have declined.

Thought:
Based on the knowledge from both passages, we can see that the authors would likely agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

Criticism:
No evident flaws in the thought process. The information derived from both passages supports the notion that wild tiger populations are recovering to different extents in various countries.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge: 
Passage 1 mentions:
- The number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
- Several countries, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia, have seen an increase in wild tiger populations in recent years.

Passage 2 mentions:
- Apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.
- Countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.

Thought:
Both passages discuss the challenges and progress in wild tiger population sizes and conservation efforts and establish that some regions have seen potential growth while others have experienced declines.

A: recovering more fully in certain countries than in others - This statement is supported by both passages as they mention regions where tiger populations have increased and others where they have declined.

B: beginning to return to the levels recorded in 2010 - Neither passage suggests that the overall population is returning to 2010 levels, as both passages indicate increases in some regions and losses in others.

C: responding predictably to aggressive conservation attempts - Neither passage explicitly states that the population is predictably responding to conservation attempts, but rather discusses the challenges and uncertainties.

D: declining steadily despite continual human intervention - This statement is not accurate because both passages mention regions where tiger populations have increased.

Criticism:
All relevant facts and reasonings appear to be accurate and well-reasoned.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Passage 1:
- The number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
- The commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population.
- Though several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.

Passage 2:
- The planet’s wild tiger population was at last on the rise, numbering 3,890 individuals.
- In a few reserves in India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.
- Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.

Thoughts:
- Both passages mention the overall growth of the global tiger population.
- Both passages also mention that some countries have experienced population growth, while others have seen a decline or loss of tiger populations.
- Therefore, the authors would both agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar. In 1789,.the French formed a new governmental body known as the.National Assembly, ushering in the tumultuous period of.political and social change known as the French Revolution..To make a government requires no great.prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience,.and the work is done. To give freedom is still more.easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to.let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is,.to temper together these opposite elements of liberty.and restraint in one consistent work, requires much.thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and.combining mind. This I do not find in those who.take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they.are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather.believe it. It would put them below the common level.of human understanding. But when the leaders.choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of.popularity, their talents, in the construction of the.state, will be of no service. They will become.flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not.the guides, of the people. If any of them should.happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly.limited and defined with proper qualifications, he.will be immediately outbid by his competitors who.will produce something more splendidly popular..Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause..Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of.cowards, and compromise as the prudence of.traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which.may enable him to temper and moderate, on some.occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become.active in propagating doctrines and establishing.powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.at which he ultimately might have aimed..But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all.that deserves commendation in the indefatigable.labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among.an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some.good may have been done. They who destroy.everything certainly will remove some grievance..They who make everything new have a chance that.they may establish something beneficial. To give.them credit for what they have done in virtue of the.authority they have usurped, or which can excuse.them in the crimes by which that authority has been.acquired, it must appear that the same things could.not have been accomplished without producing such.a revolution. Most assuredly they might....Some.usages have been abolished on just grounds, but.they were such that if they had stood as they were to.all eternity, they would little detract from the.happiness and prosperity of any state. The.improvements of the National Assembly are.superficial, their errors fundamental..Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather.to recommend to our neighbors the example of the.British constitution than to take models from them.for the improvement of our own. In the former, they.have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think,.without some causes of apprehension and complaint,.but these they do not owe to their constitution but to.their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing.to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and.not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to.what we have left standing in our several reviews and.reformations as well as to what we have altered or.superadded. Our people will find employment.enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent.spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I.would not exclude alteration neither, but even when.I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to.my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I.should follow the example of our ancestors. I would.make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style.of the building. A politic caution, a guarded.circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional.timidity were among the ruling principles of our.forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being.illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of.France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they.acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and.fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus.fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct.attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution.if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their.bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve.what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground.of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to.admire rather than attempt to follow in their.desperate flights the aeronauts of France.

- Option B: Expanding the size of the government is not discussed in the passage as a direct issue that Burke has with the National Assembly.
- Option C: The passage specifically mentions that the leaders of the National Assembly are focused on gaining popularity and public approval. This is a significant part of Burke's criticism, as he claims that they are pandering to the public rather than acting as effective leaders and legislators.
- Option D: While not explicitly mentioned, ignoring advice from former leaders might be inferred from the criticisms present in the passage. However, the passage's focus is more on the assembly's quest for popularity and the flaws in their approach to governance.

Criticism:
- Option A doesn't fit well with the main concern highlighted in the passage.
- Option B is not mentioned or discussed in the passage.
- Option C is mentioned and heavily explored, as Burke criticizes the leaders of the National Assembly for prioritizing public approval over effective decision-making.
- Option D is not a strong inference that can be made based on what is discussed in the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
  The passage discusses Burke's views on the French Revolution and the National Assembly.
  A: Limiting the king's power refers to reducing the authority of a monarch in government, which is a common theme of the French Revolution.
  B: Expanding the size of the government means increasing the number of government bodies or representatives.
  C: Seeking the approval of the public suggests the desire for popular support.
  D: Ignoring the advice of former leaders implies disregard for previous experiences and wisdom.

Thought:
  The passage highlights Burke's concerns about the National Assembly's decision-making process and its impact on the development of a free government.
  Burke criticizes the leaders of the National Assembly for focusing on popularity and not taking a more thoughtful, prudent approach to establish a balanced government.
  Burke also discusses the importance of following the example of ancestors, maintaining existing systems, and adopting a cautious approach when implementing changes.
  
Criticism:
  The passage directly mentions the focus on popularity and the exclusion of more cautious, moderate proposals in the National Assembly.
  Therefore, option "C: seek the approval of the public" can be inferred as something that particularly upsets Burke.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Knowledge: 
  The passage is a criticism of the French National Assembly and their approach towards forming a free government during the French Revolution.
  A: Limiting the king's power is a concern in the French Revolution but is not explicitly mentioned in the passage as the reason for Burke's upset. 
  B: Expanding the size of the government is not explicitly mentioned as the reason for Burke's upset in the passage.
  C: Seeking the approval of the public is discussed as one of the issues Burke has with the National Assembly, particularly when he talks about the leaders becoming "bidders at an auction of popularity".
  D: Ignoring the advice of former leaders is not explicitly mentioned in the passage as the reason for Burke's upset.

Thought:
  The passage discusses Burke's criticism of the leaders of the National Assembly as they seem more focused on gaining popularity than on properly constructing a free government that balances liberty and restraint.
  The option that closely aligns with this concern is C: seek the approval of the public.

Criticism:
  The information from the passage supports the thought process, and option C lines up with Burke's criticism of the leaders of the National Assembly focusing on popularity rather than proper governance.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
- Edmund Burke was a British politician and scholar.
- He discusses the French Revolution and the National Assembly in the given passage.
- Burke seems to critique the National Assembly's actions and motivations.

A: Limit the king's power - This option is not mentioned explicitly in the passage, nor is it clear that Burke is focusing on this point.
B: Expand the size of the government - Burke does not mention any concerns specifically targeting the size of the government in the passage.
C: Seek the approval of the public - Burke indeed criticizes the National Assembly's tendency to bid for popularity, and suggests their overeager pursuit of popularity undermines their ability to construct a proper state.
D: Ignore the advice of former leaders - While Burke does discuss the importance of learning from the past and admiring the British constitution, he is not specifically criticizing the National Assembly for ignoring the advice of former leaders.

Thought: 
Since Burke explicitly criticizes the National Assembly for seeking approval from the public, which can hinder their ability to govern effectively, Option C seems to be the closest to what Burke is most upset by in the passage.

Criticism: 
Revisiting the passage and the given choices, it still appears that Option C is the most appropriate choice from what can be inferred from the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Information from the passage:
- Burke criticizes the National Assembly's leaders for becoming "bidders at an auction of popularity"
- He believes that they turn into "flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not the guides, of the people."
- In order to outdo their competitors, they propagate doctrines and establish powers that may ultimately defeat any sober purpose.

Thought:
- Burke's criticism focuses on the National Assembly's excessive pursuit of popularity and the inability to make moderate and well-thought decisions.
- Thus, the answer should revolve around this central theme.

Analysis of choices:
  A: The passage does not specifically mention the limitation of the king's power.
  B: The passage does not specifically mention the expansion of government size.
  C: From the passage, Burke criticizes the National Assembly's decision to excessively seek the approval of the public. This aligns with the central theme of the passage.

  D: Ignoring the advice of former leaders is not explicitly mentioned in the passage.

Thought:
  In the passage, Burke criticizes the actions of the National Assembly and their decision-making process.
  His main concern seems to be the Assembly's focus on gaining public approval instead of using wisdom, restraint, and deep reflection when forming a government.
  Therefore, the answer should be C: seek the approval of the public.

Criticism:
  The passage does not provide explicit evidence for options B and D, so they can be eliminated as possible answers.
  Option A, limiting the king's power, is mentioned as part of the context but is not the main focus of Burke's criticism.
  The reasoning for the choice C is correct, and it does reflect Burke's main concern in the passage.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: For too long now, we have heard it argued that a focus.on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ rights.takes away from a focus on addressing Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples’ disadvantage..This approach is, in my view, seriously flawed for a.number of reasons. It represents a false dichotomy—as if.poorer standards of health, lack of access to housing,.lower attainment in education and higher unemployment.are not human rights issues or somehow they don’t relate.to the cultural circumstances of Indigenous peoples..And it also makes it too easy to disguise any causal.relationship between the actions of government and any.outcomes, and therefore limits the accountability and.responsibilities of government..In contrast, human rights give Aboriginal and Torres.Strait Islander peoples a means for expressing their.legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and most.importantly, the protections of the law—and a standard.that government is required to measure up to..The focus on ‘practical measures’ was exemplified by.the emphasis the previous federal government placed on.the ‘record levels of expenditure’ annually on Indigenous.issues..As I have previously asked, since when did the size of.the input become more important than the intended.outcomes? The... government never explained what the.point of the record expenditure argument was—or what.achievements were made.....And the fact is that there has been no simple way of.being able to decide whether the progress made through.‘record expenditure’ has been ‘good enough’. So the.‘practical’ approach to these issues has lacked any.accountability whatsoever.....If we look back over the past five years in particular....we can also see that a ‘practical’ approach to issues has.allowed governments to devise a whole series of policies.and programs without engaging with Indigenous peoples.in any serious manner. I have previously described this as.the ‘fundamental flaw’ of the federal government’s efforts.over the past five years. That is, government policy that is.applied to Indigenous peoples as passive recipients..Our challenge now is to redefine and understand these.issues as human rights issues..We face a major challenge in ‘skilling up’ government.and the bureaucracy so that they are capable of utilising.human rights as a tool for best practice policy.development and as an accountability mechanism..... In March this year, the Prime Minister, the Leader.of the Opposition, Ministers for Health and Indigenous.Affairs, every major Indigenous and non-Indigenous.peak health body and others signed a Statement of Intent.to close the gap in health inequality which set out how.this commitment would be met. It commits all of these.organisations and government, among other things, to:.- develop a long-term plan of action, that is targeted.to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing.the existing inequities in health services, in order to.achieve equality of health status and life expectancy.between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030..- ensure the full participation of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples and their.representative bodies in all aspects of addressing.their health needs..- work collectively to systematically address the social.determinants that impact on achieving health.equality for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.peoples..- respect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and.Torres Strait Islander peoples, and.- measure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts,.in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to.ensure that we are progressively realising our.shared ambitions..These commitments were made in relation to.Indigenous health issues but they form a template for the.type of approach that is needed across all areas of.poverty, marginalisation and disadvantage experienced.by Indigenous peoples..They provide the basis for the cultural shift necessary.in how we conceptualise human rights in this country..Issues of entrenched and ongoing poverty and.marginalisation of Indigenous peoples are human rights.challenges. And we need to lift our expectations of what.needs to be done to address these issues and of what.constitutes sufficient progress to address these issues in.the shortest possible timeframe so that we can realise a.vision of an equal society.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Knowledge:

  B: The focus of the passage is not on standardizing practices across all departments.
  C: The passage does not specifically mention the abuse of authority by government officials.

Knowledge:
- Calma is discussing the approach to indigenous health policies.
- The government's "record expenditure" is criticized for lacking clear goals and outcomes.
- Calma argues that this approach lacks accountability.

Thought:
- The text criticizes the government's approach for not linking expenditures to specific health outcomes.
- The text emphasizes the need for accountability in government policies.
- It implies that specifications and outcomes are essential to evaluate government policies' success effectively.

Criticism:
- Though all choices address various negative aspects of government actions, the text mainly discusses the lack of accountability due to unclear outcomes linked with health initiatives.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the argument that focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights takes away from addressing their disadvantages. Calma argues that this approach is flawed since health, education, and employment are human rights issues. The passage critiques the previous government's focus on "practical measures" through "record levels of expenditure" without properly explaining the outcomes and achievements. Calma also points out the lack of accountability and the necessity to redefine these issues as human rights issues.

Thought: 
  According to Calma, the government's failure to link its expenditures on indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes is harmful. This is because the lack of direct correlation between spending and outcomes allows the government to evade responsibility and accountability for its policies and actions.

Criticism: 
  The passage seems consistent and accurate in its discussion of the flaws in the government's approach to addressing the disadvantages of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Text analysis:
- The text is discussing the issue of focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights and disadvantage.
- Calma, the author, believes the government's approach is seriously flawed for multiple reasons.
- The government previously emphasized 'record levels of expenditure' related to Indigenous issues.
- Calma contends that the input size should not be more important than the intended outcomes.
- The government never clarified the purpose of this record expenditure or what they achieved.
- The 'practical' approach to these issues lacks accountability.

Answer:
- The text mentions the inadequacy of the government's approach, particularly the expenditure without linking it to specific health outcomes.
- As a result, the text supports the idea that it allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Knowledge: 
  The passage discusses the government’s focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights and standings. It mentions how practical measures are lacking accountability and have not engaged Indigenous peoples properly. The emphasis of the government on "record levels of expenditure" without clear outcomes is criticized, and it highlights the need to understand the issues as human rights matters.

Thought:
  A: Reinforces negative attitudes about the government’s financial fitness: The passage does not mention this as a harm of failing to link expenditures to specific health outcomes.
  B: Undermines efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government: This is not mentioned as a consequence of not linking expenditures to health outcomes.
  C: Perpetuates the pattern of government officials abusing their authority: While this could be inferred, it is not directly mentioned as a harm of failing to link expenditures to specific health outcomes.
  D: Allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies: The passage seems to suggest this as it mentions how practical measures lack accountability and that there has been no simple way of deciding whether the progress made through "record expenditure" has been good enough.

Criticism: 
  My thought process is accurate, as option D closely aligns with the passage's criticism of government's failure to link expenditures on indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Recap of the passage:
- Calma argues that focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights does not take away from addressing their disadvantages.
- The passage states that the previous government focused on "practical measures" and the amount of money spent on Indigenous issues, but the outcomes were not clear or explained.
- Calma criticizes the government's approach and expresses a need for accountability and a focus on human rights.
- The passage includes a roadmap for what needs to be done to address these issues in the shortest possible timeframe.

Based on the context provided, let's evaluate each of the answer choices:

A: reinforces negative attitudes about the government’s financial fitness.
- The passage does mention the government's financial focus but does not mention anything about negative attitudes about the government's financial fitness. This choice seems unrelated to the question.

B: undermines efforts to standardize practices across all departments of the government.
- The passage doesn't specifically mention standardizing practices across government departments. So, this choice seems unconnected to the main point of the passage.

C: perpetuates the pattern of government officials abusing their authority.
- The passage doesn't address government officials abusing their authority, so this choice is not related to the main point.

D: allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.
- The passage criticizes the government's approach and expresses a need for accountability for its expenditures and focus on human rights. Calma points out that the government hasn't explained the achievements made through record expenditures, leading to a lack of accountability. This choice aligns with the central concerns discussed in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Knowledge: 
  Calma discusses government expenditures on indigenous health initiatives in the provided passage. The author argues that measuring only the size of the input (expenditure) rather than the intended outcomes is problematic. Calma clearly criticizes this approach since it lacks accountability. Accountability is the ability to ensure that someone is responsible and answerable for their actions, particularly in the case of governments. 

Thought:
  By looking at the options, we can analyze which one aligns with the main idea of the passage:

  A: Negative attitudes about the government's financial fitness are not mentioned nor implied in the context.
  B: The text does not mention a desire for standardized practices across government departments.
  C: The text does not specifically bring up government officials abusing their authority.
  D: The passage specifically highlights a lack of accountability caused by focusing on expenditure rather than outcomes. The author also addresses the lack of causal relationships between government actions and their outcomes, which further supports the idea of accountability.

  Therefore, choice D best aligns with Calma's argument in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- Calma is discussing the human rights-related consequences of government policies.
- He emphasizes the need for government accountability in addressing Indigenous issues.
- The excerpt criticizes the previous federal government's focus on expenditure rather than outcomes.

Thought:
- Calma believes that the focus on expenditure instead of outcomes allows the government to avoid accountability for their policies.

Criticism:
- The thought process and understanding of the text seems correct and logically sound.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Recap of Relevant Information:
  According to Calma, the government's focus on "record levels of expenditure" on Indigenous issues is not linked to specific health outcomes or achievements.
  Calma implies that input sizes are less important than intended outcomes.
  Calma believes accountability is lacking in the "practical" approach to Indigenous issues.
  He suggests that focusing on human rights would provide a better foundation for achieving outcomes and holding the government accountable.

Options:
  A: The passage does not specifically discuss negative attitudes about the government's financial fitness.
  B: The passage does mention the need for standardization, but not as a direct consequence of linking expenditures to health outcomes.
  C: Abuse of authority is not mentioned as a consequence of the government's failure to link expenditures to health outcomes.
  D: Calma discusses the lack of accountability and responsibility as a result of the government's failure to link expenditures to specific outcomes, aligning with Calma's views.

Thoughts: 
  The text revolves around the idea of linking government spending on Indigenous issues to specific outcomes and consequences for Indigenous people. Calma suggests that accountability is crucial for making progress and, in her view, the current approach lacks it.

Criticism:
  The available options don't exactly match the wording from the text but reflect the general context in which the issue of linking expenditures to outcomes is raised.
  Option D: While the word "answerable" is not present in the text, it appears to be the closest to the points made by Calma. The other options do not accurately summarize Calma's claims or concerns.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open
Question: Based on the passage, a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it
Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  The Venus flytrap needs multiple triggers to close its trap because closing the trap requires a significant amount of energy, and reopening it takes several hours.
  A: The passage does not mention that the plant can identify the species of its prey through multiple triggers.
  B: The passage does not specifically mention conservation of the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: The passage mentions that the plant wants to ensure that its prey is large enough to be worth the energy spent closing and reopening the trap.
  D: The passage does not specifically mention the plant preventing itself from closing before capturing its prey.
  
Thought:
  The flytrap requires multiple triggers to close its trap.
  The Venus flytrap's multiple triggers help it conserve energy by closing only when a large enough prey is present.
  The most fitting answer based on the passage is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.

Criticism:
  The passage does mention energy conservation as a significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's multiple triggers.
  Answer C aligns with the information provided in the passage.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Relevant Information:
- Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours.
- Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
- If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.

Thought:
- The passage states that the Venus flytrap's trap requires a lot of energy to close and a significant amount of time to reopen.
- The flytrap wants to ensure that it captures a prey that is worth the energy expenditure before closing.
- This system increases the chance that the captured prey is large enough to be worth the energy because the plant won't close unless it gets multiple triggers, ensuring the potential prey is larger when it triggers multiple hairs.

Criticism:
- The thought process is accurate, and the relevant information from the passage has been considered.

Answer:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First, let's review the relevant knowledge from the passage about each option:

A: There is no direct mention in the passage that the requirement for multiple triggers enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.

B: While the passage talks about calcium concentration in the trap, it does not explicitly say that the requirement for multiple triggers conserves the plant's calcium reserves.

C: The passage mentions that closing the trap requires a huge expense of energy and reopening the trap can take several hours. Therefore, the plant wants to make sure that it is only closing the trap when it is sure of catching prey that is large enough to be worth its time.

D: The passage does say that if a small ant takes up some time to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch when the ant brushes against the next hair. In this case, the trap doesn't close, and the ant escapes. However, this explanation is not directly related to the multiple triggers advantage.

Now, let's think step by step:

The passage states that the Venus flytrap requires two hairs to be touched within 20 seconds for the trap to close. This serves as a mechanism that helps the plant determine if the prey is large enough to be worth its time. By requiring multiple triggers, the plant ensures that it will only utilize its energy to close the trap when it is more likely to catch a meal that is worth the energy expenditure.

Based on our understanding, we can infer that the advantage of multiple triggers is to conserve the plant's energy supply.

Criticism:

We have analyzed the information in the passage and the options given. Our inference that the advantage of multiple triggers conserves the plant's energy supply is consistent with the information presented in the passage. There are no flaws in our facts, logic, or reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Knowledge:
A: Identifying the species of its prey is not mentioned in the passage as a necessary function of the Venus flytrap's multiple triggers.
B: The passage does discuss calcium reserves and their role in the triggering mechanism, but conservation of calcium reserves is not explicitly mentioned as an advantage of the multiple triggers.
C: Safeguarding the plant's energy supply is mentioned in the context that closing its trap requires a considerable expense of energy and reopening the trap can take several hours.
D: The passage mentions that the Venus flytrap only wants to close when it is sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time, which prevents it from unnecessarily closing and reopening its trap.

Thought:
A: The passage does not mention identifying the species of its prey as a function of the multiple triggers.
B: The passage talks about calcium and its role in the trapping mechanism, but it does not mention conserving calcium reserves.
C: The passage clearly states that closing the trap requires a significant expense of energy; therefore, ensuring the insect is of a size worth trapping helps safeguard the plant's energy supply.
D: By having multiple triggers, the Venus flytrap can be more certain that it is large enough prey before closing the trap, assisting in preventing unnecessary trapping and energy waste.

Criticism:
The information in the passage supports the idea that the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers helps safeguard its energy supply (C) and prevent it from closing before capturing its prey (D). Of the two choices, (C) is more aligned with a significant advantage since conserving energy is mentioned as an essential part of why multiple triggers are needed. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Knowledge:
- The Venus flytrap needs to identify a meal worth its time and energy.
- Closing its trap requires a significant amount of energy, and reopening the trap takes hours.
- Large black hairs on its lobes act as triggers for closing the trap.
- Touching one hair is not enough to close the trap; touching two hairs in about 20 seconds signals the trap to close.
- If the trap doesn't close, the insect can escape.

Thought:
- The passage mainly focuses on the energy conservation and prey identification processes.
- A: identifying the species is not the main advantage, as the plant's focus is on the size of the prey.
- B: conserving calcium reserves isn't the main advantage discussed, although it's a part of the triggering system.
- C: energy conservation is a key advantage, as the plant only closes when it's sure the prey is worth the effort.
- D: preventing premature closing is related to energy conservation and ensuring a worthwhile prey.

Criticism:
- A: linked to prey identification but not directly stated as a significant advantage.
- B: although calcium is part of the process, energy conservation is the main focus.
- C: this aligns well with the passage and the plant's focus on identifying a sizeable prey.
- D: while true, energy conservation is the root cause for this advantage; thus, option C is more accurate.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Knowledge:
  From the passage, we know that:
  - The Venus flytrap needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
  - Closing the trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours.
  - The large black hairs on the lobes act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  - If an insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut.
  - A large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
  - This system is analogous to short-term memory, and the trap loses the storage of the information if the time between touches is too long.

Thought:
  - The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers helps it ensure that it captures prey that is large enough and worth its energy expenditure.
  - Thus, the multiple-triggers requirement serves as a safeguard for the plant's energy supply.
  - The correct answer is C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.

Criticism:
  - There are no flaws in my facts, logic, or reasoning.

- D: Preventing the plant from closing before capturing its prey is not entirely accurate as the main goal is to capture the ideal-sized prey rather than simply avoiding premature closing.

Criticism:
- All options focus on different aspects but the passage mainly talks about energy expenses and capturing the ideal-sized prey.
- Safeguarding the plant's energy supply is the most relevant advantage discussed in the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Knowledge:
The passage states that the Venus flytrap requires a lot of energy to close its trap, and reopening the trap takes several hours. It only wants to spring closed when it is sure the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.

Thoughts:
A: The passage doesn't mention that the multiple triggers help identify the species of its prey.
B: The passage states that the plant needs a certain level of calcium concentration to close, but it doesn't specifically mention conserving calcium reserves as the reason for multiple triggers.
C: The passage mentions that closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy. Requiring multiple triggers ensures that the plant will only close when it's sure an insect is large enough, thereby conserving its energy supply.
D: The passage doesn't mention that the multiple triggers prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey. It focuses more on the significance of the insect's size and energy conservation.

Criticism:
A is not mentioned in the passage.
B is related to the calcium concentration but not the main advantage of the multiple triggers.
C reflects the passage most accurately since it mentions the expense of energy and the plant's desire only to close the trap when it's sure an insect is large enough to be worth it.
D is not mentioned as a significant advantage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Relevant knowledge: 
  Closing the Venus flytrap's trap requires a huge expense of energy.
  Reopening the trap can take several hours, so the Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  The large black hairs on the flytrap's lobes allow it to feel their prey and act as triggers.
  If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; however, a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs in about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.

Thoughts:
  A: The passage doesn't mention the plant identifying the species of its prey, only that it responds to size requirements.
  B: The passage doesn't specifically mention conserving calcium reserves, but the plant requires a higher concentration of calcium ions to close.
  C: The passage mentions that closing the trap requires a lot of energy, so requiring multiple triggers helps make sure that the insect is big enough to be worth its time.
  D: The passage doesn't mention the plant closing before capturing its prey unless two hairs are successfully touched within the 20 seconds timeframe.

Criticism:
  A: Can be ruled out because the passage doesn't mention anything about the plant identifying the species of its prey.
  B: Even though calcium concentration plays a role in the mechanism's functioning, the passage doesn't specifically mention conserving calcium reserves as an advantage.
  C: Requiring multiple triggers helps conserve energy by only shutting the trap when the insect is big enough, which is mentioned in the text.
  D: Can be ruled out because the passage doesn't mention the plant closing before capturing its prey unless the two triggers are activated.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage explains the action of Venus flytrap closing its trap when an insect is on its surface.
  A: Identifying species of prey is not mentioned in the text.
  B: Conserving calcium reserves is related to the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers as well as Volkov's experiments, which suggest that the Venus flytrap needs to reach a certain threshold of calcium concentration to close.
  C: Safeguarding the plant's energy supply is mentioned in the first paragraph, discussing the energy expense of closing and reopening the trap.
  D: Preventing the plant from closing before capturing its prey is not the main focus, but rather ensuring that the insect is of a sufficient size to be worth the energy expended.

Thought:
  The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers helps it differentiate between larger prey worth its energy and smaller insects that may not provide enough nutrition.
  From the choices, A is not relevant, B could be related but is not the main advantage, and D is not accurate.
  Based on the passage, conserving energy is the primary concern for the Venus flytrap.
  Therefore, safeguarding the plant's energy supply (C) is the most appropriate answer.

Criticism:
  I reviewed the knowledge and thought process, and it is factually correct and logically consistent with the information in the passage.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: At field sites around the world, Ken Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their  parents. "They jumped up like popcorn," he said, 5 describing how they would flap their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air. So when a group of graduate students challenged him to come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate, he designed a project10 to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, but he might not have made his discovery without a key piece of advice from the local15 rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds. When the cowboy stopped by to see how things were going, Ken showed him his nice, tidy laboratory setup and explained how the birds' first hops and flights would be measured. The rancher20 was incredulous. "He took one look and said, in pretty colorful language, 'What are those birds doing on the ground? They hate to be on the ground! Give them something to climb on!" At first it seemed unnatural-ground birds don't like the ground? But25 as he thought about it Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They really only used the ground for feeding and traveling. So he brought30 in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. "I asked 35 him how it went," Ken recalled, "and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' " Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs. Time and again Terry had watched them run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the40 while. Ken dashed out to see for himself, and that was the "aha" moment. "The birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively," he told me, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.Working together with Terry (who has since gone 45 on to study animal locomotion), Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from 50 birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. "It's like the spoiler on the back of a race car," he explained, which is a very apt analogy. In Formula One racing, 55 spoilers are the big aerodynamic fins that push the cars downward as they speed along, increasing traction and handling. The birds were doing the very same thing with their wings to help them scramble up otherwise impossible slopes.60 Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient65 alternative to flying. In the Chukar experiments, adults regularly used WAIR to ascend ramps steeper than 90 degrees, essentially running up the wall and onto the ceiling.In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on 70 surprising explanatory powers. With one fell swoop, the Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory) and an aerodynamic function for 75 half-formed wings (one of the main drawbacks to the ground-up hypothesis)
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about gliding animals from the passage?
Choices:
  A: Their young tend to hop along beside their parents instead of flying beside them.
  B: Their method of locomotion is similar to that of ground birds.

  D: The passage states that one of the shortcomings of the tree-down theory is that gliding animals do not use a flapping flight stroke like birds do, implying that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes.

Criticism:
  The passage contrasts gliding animals with ground birds in the context of the flapping stroke, but it doesn't give information about their young, their methods of locomotion, or their feeding habits (choices A, B, and C). However, the passage implies that gliding animals do not use a flapping stroke to aid in climbing slopes (choice D).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Knowledge:
  The passage discusses how young game birds learn to fly and how they use their wings for wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
  Ken Dial and his son, Terry, documented a wide range of species using WAIR.
  The passage mentions that the Dials "came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds (something gliding animals don't do and thus a shortcoming of the tree-down theory)"

Thought:
  The passage focuses on the research of Ken and Terry Dial about birds and their wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
  The passage states that gliding animals do not use the flapping flight stroke, which is different from birds.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}"Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a human health crisis," says biochemist Kim Lewis of  Northeastern University.Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests, teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria-even those thathave developed immunity to other drugs. The scientists' best efforts to create mutant bacteria with resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin could function effectively for decades before pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. But only about one percent of these organisms can be grown in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, haveremained uncultured and of limited use to medical science, until now. "Instead of trying to figure out the ideal conditions for each and every one of the millions of organisms out there in the environment, to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply growthem in their natural environment where they already have the conditions they need for growth," Lewis says.To do this, the team designed a gadget that sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,each perforated with pores that allow molecules like nutrients to diffuse through but don't allow the passage of cells. "We just use it to trick the bacteria into thinking that they are in their natural environment," Lewis says.The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper  respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the infections with no noticeable toxic effects.It's likely that teixobactin is effective because of  the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules that the cell creates organically. Many other antibiotics target the bacteria's proteins, and the genes that encode those proteins can mutate to 50 produce different structures.\section{Passage 2}Many good antibiotic families-penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline-come from soil fungi and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if we could grow more types of bacteria from soil-or55 from exotic environments, such as deep oceans-then we might find new natural antibiotics. In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others] found that they could isolate and grow individual soil bacteria-including types that can't normally be60 grown in the laboratory-in soil itself, which supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the bacteria reached a critical mass they could be transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued. This simple and elegant methodology is their most 65 important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown before.The first new antibiotic that they've found by this 70 approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though it doesn't look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed 75 the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important because there is a real problem with resistant tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also difficult to select teixobactin resistance.So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First, 80 teixobactin isn't a potential panacea. It doesn't kill the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to commercial manufacture will be challenging, since the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to85 grow. And, thirdly, it's early days yet. As with any antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections, and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of 90 "standard of care treatment." That's going to take five years and $\pounds 500$ million and these are numbers we must find ways to reduce (while not compromising safety) if we're to keep ahead of bacteria, which can evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
Question: In the last sentence of Passage 2, the author uses the phrase "five years and $\pounds 500$ million" primarily to
Choices:
  A: emphasize the scale of the effort needed to make teixobactin available for consumer use.
  B: criticize the level of funding that the government has committed to teixobactin development.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Passage 1: The passage discusses the development of a new antibiotic, teixobactin, derived from soil microorganisms. These have been the root of most antibiotic drug development during the past century. Kim Lewis and his team designed a gadget that allowed them to grow 10,000 strains of uncultured soil bacteria in their natural environment. Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug, effectively treating mice infected with upper respiratory tract infections without noticeable toxic effects.

Passage 2: The author is cautiously optimistic about the findings related to teixobactin. They highlight the potential cultivation of never-before-grown, antibiotic-producing bacteria as the most important finding. However, they express three concerns: teixobactin is not a complete cure, scaling to commercial production will be challenging, and it faces a long process of clinical trials. The author then mentions "five years and £500 million" as the cost and time it will take to get through clinical trial phases.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

  A: emphasize the scale of the effort needed to make teixobactin available for consumer use.
  The passage does mention "five years and £500 million" in the context of the clinical trial process, which is necessary for making teixobactin available to consumers.

  B: criticize the level of funding that the government has committed to teixobactin development.
  The author does not criticize government funding or mention any specific commitment in the passage.

  C: underscore the amount of time and money that has already been spent researching teixobactin.
  The passage does not mention the amount of time or money already spent on teixobactin research. It refers to the anticipated time and cost for future clinical trials.

  D: compare the amount of money spent developing teixobactin with the amount spent developing other antibiotics
  Although the passage mentions the time and cost of developing teixobactin, it does not make any comparisons to the development of other antibiotics.

Given the analysis, the best answer is:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia, in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navyblue dress, and a little white tam that rode the wavesof her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia, although it was nothing, she said, compared to the 119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real 10 place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or15 not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like my momma said, "We weren't no poorer than we'd ever been," and the citizens of Threestep were in the 20 mood for a little excitement.Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to give it to them. She was, by almost anyone's standards, a woman of the world. She'd gone to boarding schools since she was six years old; she'd 25 studied French in Paris and drama in London; and during what she called a "fruitful intermission" in her formal education, she had traveled extensively in the Near East and Africa with a friend of her grandmother's, one Janet Miller, who was a medical30 doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education by attending Barnard College in New York City. She told us all that at school the first day. When my little brother Ralphord asked what did she study at35 Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard.It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to 40 find her true mission in life, that she wandered one afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey, who was talking about his famous book, Democracy and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat45 with students after a lecture-especially female students, she added-sometimes over coffee, and see in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss Spivey had marched to the Teacher's College and 50 signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a cheery blue-suited woman from the $\mathrm{WPA}^{1}$ that she wanted to bring democracy and education to the poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner of America.55 They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding my brother Ralphord's eye.What we really wanted to know about-all twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one 60 room-was the pearly white button hanging on a string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher's desk up front. That button on a string was something new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss65 Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment, the whole world-or at least a wrinkled map of it-unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss Chandler, had never once made use of that map, which was older than our fathers, and until that70 moment, not a one of us knew it was there.Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and past the Rock of Gibraltar into theMediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she75 gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa. They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in every crack and crevice.80 "And can you guess what we saw from the train?" Miss Spivey asked. We could not. "Camels!" she said. "We saw a whole caravan of camels." She looked around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and delighted at the thought.85 We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard, until Mavis Davis spoke up."She means like the three kings rode to Bethlehem," Mavis said, and she folded her hands smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the 90 room.Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss95 Spivey simply said, "That's right."1 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a government agency that hired people for public and cultural development projects and services.

  A: A former student would be someone who attested to their experience from a student's perspective.
  B: Miss Spivey's predecessor would refer to Miss Chandler, who was mentioned in the passage.
  C: An anonymous member of the community would not be directly involved with the school.
  D: Miss Spivey herself would narrate her story.

Thought:
  The passage is written in the first person.
  The narrator mentioned experiences in relation to Miss Spivey, such as her arrival and first day of school.
  The narrator included details about Mavis and Ralphord, who were students attending the school.
  Based on these details, it can be inferred that the narrator is likely a former student.

Criticism:
  The text supports that the narrator is directly involved with the school and experienced Miss Spivey's arrival and teaching firsthand.
  No major flaws were found in the thought process.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Recite knowledge: 
  The narrator of the passage is describing the arrival of Miss Spivey in Threestep, Georgia, and her actions and experiences with the people there, specifically the students.

Analyze options: 
  A: One of Miss Spivey's former students - This option could be plausible, as the narrator seems to be speaking from experience and knows personal details about Miss Spivey's interactions with the students.
  B: Miss Spivey's predecessor - This option is unlikely, as the narrator speaks about the predecessor ("Her predecessor, Miss Chandler…") from a third-person perspective and seems to be a part of the students' group. 
  C: An anonymous member of the community - Although this option could be possible, the emphasis on knowing what happened in the classroom makes it less likely than option A.
  D: Miss Spivey herself - The narrator refers to Miss Spivey as "she" and talks about her actions and experiences from a third-person perspective, making it unlikely that Miss Spivey is the narrator.

Thought:
  The narrator seems to be describing events from a perspective that indicates they were present in the classroom with Miss Spivey and the other students and seems to have a more intimate knowledge of the events than an anonymous community member. The language used in the passage suggests that the narrator is not Miss Spivey's predecessor or Miss Spivey herself.

Criticism:
  The thought process seems sound based on the analysis of the options and the content of the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Knowledge:
- The narrator speaks in the first person, referring to themselves and their classmates using "we" and "us."
- The narrator shares observations about Miss Spivey's arrival in Threestep, Georgia, and her interactions with her new students in the classroom.
- The narrator mentions their little brother, Ralphord, who is also a student in Miss Spivey's class.

Thought:
- A: "one of Miss Spivey's former students" seems likely since the narrator is present in the classroom and speaks about their personal experiences and observations of Miss Spivey and their classmates.
- B: "Miss Spivey's predecessor" doesn't make sense because the narrator is a student in Miss Spivey's class who was also present during Miss Chandler's tenure.
- C: "an anonymous member of the community" doesn't fit because the narrator is clearly a student in Miss Spivey's class, sharing personal experiences and observations.
- D: "Miss Spivey herself" is incorrect because the narrator speaks about Miss Spivey in the third person, as a distinct individual separate from themselves.

Criticism:
- The knowledge and thought process seem to be sound, and no flaws seem to be present.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Recitation:
  A: one of Miss Spivey's former students - This option suggests that the narrator was once a student of Miss Spivey's.
  B: Miss Spivey's predecessor - This option implies the narrator was the person who worked before Miss Spivey.
  C: an anonymous member of the community - This option suggests that the narrator is someone unnamed from the community.
  D: Miss Spivey herself - This option suggests that the narrator is Miss Spivey narrating her own story.

Thought:
  The passage is written from a first-person perspective, referring to Miss Spivey as "she" and describing the experiences of the narrator as a part of a group (e.g., "What we really wanted to know," "We all hung there for a minute").
  The narrator discusses their experiences with Miss Spivey, referring to her as their teacher and describing her interactions with her students, implying that the narrator is one of Miss Spivey's students.
  The narrator cannot be Miss Spivey herself, as she is being described in the third person.
  The narrator cannot be Miss Spivey's predecessor, as they are discussing their experiences as a student in her class.
  The narrator cannot be an anonymous member of the community, as they are clearly participating in Miss Spivey's class, asking questions, and observing her interactions.

Criticism:
  There are no flaws in the thought process. The narrator is definitely a student of Miss Spivey's, as they are actively participating in her class and describing her teaching style.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: composite | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: English
Context: “I’ve come to inquire if you have work for me. That is, if.my performance pleased you before.” A deliberate prompt. I.didn’t want to be hired because of my need or his kindness. I.wanted my talent to be the reason he wanted me back..“Indeed” was all he offered..What now to fill the suspended moment? His new.projects. I asked. His eyebrows leapt up in symmetrical.curves..“A Byzantine chapel for the World’s Columbian.Exposition in Chicago next year. Four times bigger than the.Paris Exposition Universelle. It will be the greatest assembly.of artists since the fifteenth century.” He counted on his.fingers and then drummed them on the desk. “Only fifteen.months away. In 1893 the name of Louis Comfort Tiffany.will be on the lips of millions!” He stood up and swung open.his arms wide enough to embrace the whole world..I sensed his open palm somewhere in the air behind the.small of my back, ushering me to his massive, carved.mahogany exhibit table to see his sketches and watercolors..“Two round windows, The Infancy of Christ and Botticelli’s.Madonna and Child, will be set off by a dozen scenic side.windows.”.A huge undertaking. How richly fortunate. Surely there.would be opportunity for me to shine..Practically hopping from side to side, he made a show of.slinging down one large watercolor after another onto the.Persian carpet, each one a precise, fine-edged rendering of.what he wanted the window to be..“Gracious! You’ve been on fire. Go slower! Give me a.chance to admire each one.”.He unrolled the largest watercolor. “An eight-foot.mosaic behind the altar depicting a pair of peacocks.surrounded by grapevines.”.My breath whistled between my open lips. Above the.peacocks facing each other, he had transformed the.standard Christian icon of a crown of thorns into a.shimmering regal headdress for God the King, the thorns.replaced by large glass jewels in true Tiffany style..Astonishing how he could get mere watercolors so deep.and saturated, so like lacquer that they vibrated together as.surely as chords of a great church pipe organ. Even the.names of the hues bore an exotic richness. The peacocks’.necks in emerald green and sapphire blue. The tail feathers.in vermilion, Spanish ocher, Florida gold. The jewels in the.crown mandarin yellow and peridot. The background in.turquoise and cobalt. Oh, to get my hands on those.gorgeous hues. To feel the coolness of the blue glass, like.solid pieces of the sea. To chip the gigantic jewels for the.crown so they would sparkle and send out shafts of light..To forget everything but the glass before me and make of it.something resplendent..When I could trust my voice not to show too much.eagerness, I said, “I see your originality is in good health..Only you would put peacocks in a chapel.”.“Don’t you know?” he said in a spoof of incredulity..“They symbolized eternal life in Byzantine art. Their flesh.was thought to be incorruptible.”.“What a lucky find for you, that convenient tidbit of.information.”.He chuckled, so I was on safe ground..He tossed down more drawings. “A marble-and-mosaic.altar surrounded by mosaic columns, and a baptismal font.of opaque leaded glass and mosaic.”.“This dome is the lid of the basin? In opaque leaded.glass?”.He looked at it with nothing short of love, and showed.me its size with outstretched arms as though he were.hugging the thing..I was struck by a tantalizing idea. “Imagine it reduced in.size and made of translucent glass instead. Once you figure.how to secure the pieces in a dome, that could be the.method and the shape of a lampshade. A wraparound.window of, say”—I looked around the room—“peacock.feathers.”.He jerked his head up with a startled expression, the.idea dawning on him as if it were his own..“Lampshades in leaded glass,” he said in wonder, his.blue eyes sparking..“Just think where that could go,” I whispered.

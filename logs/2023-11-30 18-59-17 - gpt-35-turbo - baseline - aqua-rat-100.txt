Question: A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 15
  C: 18
  D: 20
  E: 30
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can start by using the formula: Total = Group1 + Group2 - Both

Let's plug in the given values:
45 = 30 + 20 - Both

Simplifying the equation, we get:
Both = 5

So the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 5.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Since the total number of books can't be greater than 45 and we know that there are only 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, we can determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction by taking the minimum of these two quantities.

Question: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 22
  C: 20
  D: 23
  E: 24
Response 0:
We can use a proportion to solve the problem. 

Let x be the height of the tree. Then we have:

   height of pole / length of pole shadow = height of tree / length of tree shadow

   14 / 10 = x / 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

   x = (14 /10) * 15 = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")  
The correct answer is B: 22.
Let x be the height of the tree in metres.
We can set up the proportion: 
  tree height / tree shadow = electric pole height / electric pole shadow
  x / 15 = 14 / 10
Simplifying this proportion, we get: 
  x = (15 * 14) / 10
  x = 21
Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 metres.

Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability of occurrence of event B. 

The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by: P(A U B) = 0.96.

Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
        P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B),
        where P(A n B) is the probability of the intersection of events A and B.

Since A and B are independent, P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B) 
(Recall that for independent events A and B, P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B))

Substituting the given values in the formula: 

  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
  0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4P(B)
  P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / 0.4
  P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) be the probability that B occurs.  
Then the probability that at least one of A or B occurs is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), since the event of both A and B occurring is counted twice.

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

So we have the equation:
  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Solving for P(B), we get:
  P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6)
       = 0.36 / 0.4
       = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's start solving the problem by using the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B), where P(A U B) is the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability that both A and B occur. Since events A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting the values we know, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)
0.96 = 0.6(1 + P(B))
1 + P(B) = 1.6
P(B) = 0.6

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.6.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B.
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Substituting the values given, we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) = 0.6 and that P(A or B) = 0.96.

We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) is the probability that both event A and event B occur.

Since events A and B are independent, we have P(A and B) = P(A)·P(B).

Substituting these expressions into the formula, we get:

  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
  0.36 = 0.4P(B)
  P(B) = 0.36/0.4
  P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(B) = x. 

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Given that A and B are independent, the probability of their intersection (i.e. both happening at the same time) is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) 

Putting this all together, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 * x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 0.8

So the probability that event B occurs is 0.8.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let P(B) = x. Then, P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.6 + x - (0.6)(x) = 0.96
Solving the equation above, we get x = 0.8
Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.8.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let P(B) = x. 
As A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
=> P(A and B) = 0.6x
We know that at least one of the events A or B will occur, 
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x
Solving this equation,
x = 0.8

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to solve the problem. Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Let x be the probability that event B occurs. We can set up the equation 0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x and solve for x.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's call Meenu's weight "M". According to the information provided:
M = 29 + 1/2*M
Solving for M:
M - 1/2*M = 29
1/2*M = 29
M = 58
So Meenu weighs 58 kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's represent Meenu's weight as "w". 
According to the information given in the problem, Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight: 29 + (1/2)w.
To find Meenu's weight, we can set up an equation: 
w = 29 + (1/2)w
Solving for w: 
(1/2)w = 29
w = 58

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's first simplify Meenu's statement: she weighs 29 Kgs plus 0.5 times her weight, or 29 + 0.5w = w + 29.
Subtracting 29 from both sides we get 0.5w = w - 29 which simplifies to 0.5w = -29.
Multiplying both sides by 2 we get w = -58. 

Since a negative weight doesn't make sense, so we need to reject this solution.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem.
Let's assume that Meenu's weight is "w".
From the given information, we can set up an equation:
w = 29 + 0.5w

Now, we can solve for "w":
0.5w = 29
w = 29/0.5 = 58

So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
First, let's calculate the speed of the space shuttle. 

Action: Answer("A")

The space shuttle can travel 700m in 40 seconds at its maximum speed. 

So, its speed is: 

speed = distance / time 
speed = 700 m / 40 s 
speed = 17.5 m/s 

Now, we need to find the length of the space shuttle. 

We know that it takes the space shuttle 5 seconds to pass a point. Let's call the length of the space shuttle "x". 

During these 5 seconds, the space shuttle would have traveled: 

distance = speed x time 
distance = 17.5 m/s x 5 s 
distance = 87.5 m 

However, this distance includes the length of the space shuttle itself. So, we need to subtract the length of the space shuttle from 87.5 m: 

87.5 m - x = length of shuttle 

Finally, we can solve for x: 

87.5 m - x = length of shuttle 
x = 87.5 m - length of shuttle 

Since we want to find the length of the space shuttle, we can assign x as the length of the shuttle: 

x = 87.5 m - x 
2x = 87.5 m 
x = 43.75 m 

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is approximately 43.75m.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem. Let Y be the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. We are given that the store had 600 golf balls in total, which means that the number of white golf balls is (600 - Y). At the end of the day, the store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8*600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, it sold (600 - Y) white golf balls. That means it also sold (600 - Y) yellow golf balls. 

We can set up an equation based on the information above and solve for Y:
(600 - Y) + (600 - Y) = 480
Simplifying this equation:
1200 - 2Y = 480
Subtracting 1200 from both sides:
-2Y = -720
Dividing by -2:
Y = 360

Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Solution: 

Let y = number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day
Let w = number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day

We know that at the beginning of the day, the store had 600 golf balls in stock: 

y + w = 600 

We also know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls by the end of the day, which means that it sold 0.8(600) = 480 golf balls. 

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and sold all of its white golf balls, we can set up the following equation: 

0.5y = 480 

Solving for y: 

y = 960 

Therefore, the store had 960 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let x be the number of white golf balls.
Thus, the total number of golf balls is 2x, and after selling 80%, the store had sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls.
Since the number of yellow balls sold equals the number of white balls sold at the end of the day, the store sold x white golf balls.
Then the store sold (2x - x) = x yellow golf balls.
Since the store sold all of the white golf balls, they sold x white and thus the store began the day with (2x - x) + x = 2x yellow golf balls.
We can now find x:
480 balls = 0.8 * (2x) <- Equation 1
Solving for x:
2x = 600
x = 300

Using the above derivation, the store had 2x = 2 * 300 = 600 golf balls at the beginning, which were yellow golf balls.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's work it out together.

The store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. Therefore, it sold 80/100 * 600 = <<80/100*600=480>>480 golf balls.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 white golf balls because 480/2 = <<480/2=240>>240
Thus, at the beginning of the day, the store had 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 yellow golf balls in stock.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls that the store had to begin the day.
* The total number of golf balls that the store had in stock is 600.
* The store sold 80% of its stock, which means that it sold 0.8*600 = <<0.8*600=480>>480 golf balls.
* The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, which means that it sold 240 yellow golf balls.
* In doing so, the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means that the store had none left to begin the day.
* Therefore, the store must have had 240 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. We know that the length of the shorter piece is 3 meters less than the length of the longer piece, which means its length is x - 3 meters. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 20 meters, so we can write an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters, which is answer D. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope "x". 
The length of the shorter piece of rope will be "x-3". 
We know that the total length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x-3) = 20 

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20 

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23 

Dividing by 2, we get:

x = 11.5 

So the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters long.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let X be the length of the longer piece and Y be the length of the shorter piece. Our goal is to find X. 

We know that X + Y = 20 (since the total rope length is 20 meters).  
We also know that X = Y + 3 (since the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other). 

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: 
Y + 3 + Y = 20 
2Y + 3 = 20 
2Y = 17 
Y = 8.5 

Now we know that the length of the shorter piece is 8.5 meters. We can substitute this back into the second equation to get:
X = Y + 3 = 8.5 + 3 = 11.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's represent the length of the longer piece of rope as x meters. The length of the shorter piece of rope is 3 meters less than x, so it is (x - 3) meters long. Together, the two pieces of rope add up to the original length of 20 meters, so:

x + (x -3) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides:

2x = 23

Dividing by 2:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's denote the length of the shorter piece of rope as x.  
Then, we know that the length of the longer piece of rope will be (x+3) since it's 3 meters longer than the shorter piece.  
We also know that the lengths of both pieces add up to 20 meters, so:  
x + (x+3) = 20  
2x + 3 = 20  
2x = 17  
x = 8.5  

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope would be:  
x + 3 = 8.5 + 3 = 11.5  

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's denote the length of the longer piece of rope as x. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope would be (x - 3). We know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters. Putting it all together, we can create an equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the left side:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let the length of the longer piece of rope be x meters.
The length of the shorter piece of rope is then (x - 3) meters.
The sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is equal to the original length: x + (x - 3) = 20.
Simplifying the equation gives 2x - 3 = 20, and solving for x gives x = 11.5.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let x denote the length in meters of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length in meters of the shorter rope is x - 3. We know that both the long and short rope add up to 20 meters, therefore:

x + (x-3) = 20

If we solve for x, we get:

2x = 23

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope is 11.5.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let L be the length of the longer piece of rope. We know that the length of the shorter piece is 3 meters less than the longer piece. So the length of the shorter piece is (L-3). We also know that the length of the two pieces together is 20 meters. 

L + (L-3) = 20 
2L - 3 = 20 
2L = 23 
L = 11.5 

So the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length of the shorter piece is x - 3. The sum of their lengths is equal to the length of the entire rope: 

x + (x-3) = 20 

Simplifying the equation, 

2x - 3 = 20 

Adding 3 to both sides, 

2x = 23 

Dividing both sides by 2, 

x = 11.5 

Therefore, the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters long.

Topic: Math
Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:
  A: 90
  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Let's start by finding out the ratio of red sweets to green sweets as a fraction. We know that for every 4 parts of green sweets, there are 3 parts of red sweets. This can be represented as 3/7. 
If we know that there are 120 green sweets, we can set up the following equation:

3/7 = x/120

where x represents the number of red sweets. 

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation by cross-multiplying:

7x = 3 * 120
x = 360/7

This is approximately 51.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a sweet, we round up to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, there are 52 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("None of the Above") [since none of the given choices is the correct answer]
Response 1:
Let the number of red sweets be 3x (since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4).
According to the problem, the number of green sweets is 120. Thus, the number of green sweets is 4x (since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4).
Then, we can use this equation to solve for x:
4x = 120
x = 30

To find the number of red sweets, we can substitute x = 30 into the equation 3x:
3x = 3(30) = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can begin solving this problem by using ratios. The ratio of red sweets to green sweets in the bag is given as 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets there are 4 green sweets. We are also given that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. 

Let's use these two pieces of information to find the total number of sweets in the bag. 

If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, then the ratio of the total number of sweets to the number of green sweets is 3:4 as well. Let's use "x" to represent the total number of sweets in the bag: 

3/4 = x/120 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

3 × 120 = 4 × x 

360 = 4x 

x = 90 

So the bag contains a total of 90 sweets. 

Finally, we can use the ratio of red sweets to green sweets to find the number of red sweets in the bag. 

If there are 3 red sweets for every 4 green sweets, that means the ratio of red sweets to the total number of sweets is 3:7 (since 3 + 4 = 7). 

So out of the 90 sweets in the bag, we can find the number of red sweets as: 

3/7 × 90 = 30 

Therefore, there are 30 red sweets in the bag. 

Answer: Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Solution: 

Let x be the number of red sweets.

According to the problem, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means we can write:

x/120 = 3/4

To solve for x, we cross-multiply:

4x = 360

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let R be the number of red sweets in the bag. 

We know the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. Thus, we can represent the number of green sweets as (4/(3+4)) x (R + 120) = 4(R + 120)/7. 

We know that the bag contains 120 green sweets, so we can set up the equation: 

4(R + 120)/7 = 120 

Simplifying this equation gives us R = 90. 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the total number of sweets in the bag:

3/4 (total sweets) =  ratio of red to green sweets

We know that there are 4 parts (green sweets) in the ratio and we are told that there are 120 green sweets. This means that each part is 120/4 = 30.

Now that we know that each part is 30, we can calculate the total number of sweets:

3 x 30 = 90

Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
The problem can be solved using algebra.
Let "x" be the number of friends who planned to go on a picnic.
Total amount they should contribute = Rs. 96
Each person should have contributed = 96/x
But, as four of them did not show up, the amount got divided among (x-4) persons and each had to contribute 4 rupees extra. So, the new amount each person contributed = (96+(4*(x-4))) / (x-4) = (96/x) + 4
Now, we can equate both and solve for x:
(96/x) + 4 = 96/x
4 = 96/x - 96/x
4 = 96*(1/x - 1/(x-4))
1/x - 1/(x-4) = 1/24
Solving for x, we get x=8. Therefore, the number of those who attended the picnic was 8.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
To find minimum selling price per component that will guarantee at least $626,400 yearly profit, we need to calculate the yearly revenue and then subtract the yearly production cost from that. 
Yearly production cost = $110 × 420 × 12 = $554,400
Now we need to find out how much revenue we need to make sure our yearly profit is $626,400. 
Revenue + $626,400 = $554,400 + (selling price per component × 420 × 12) 
Solving for selling price,
selling price per component = (626,400 + 554,400) / (420 × 12) = $230. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component will be $230.

Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let "x" be the selling price per component, then the revenue from the sale of each of the 420 components per month is given by 420x dollars. 

The yearly revenue is 12(420x) = 5040x dollars. 

The yearly production cost is 12(420)(110) = 554400 dollars.

Thus, the yearly profit is given by: 12(420x) - 554400 dollars. 

We want to find the minimum selling price x that guarantees a yearly profit of at least 626400 dollars. Therefore, we must solve: 

12(420x) - 554400 >= 626400 

5040x >= 210800 

x >= 41.67 

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least 626400 dollars is $41.67. 

Action: Answer("None of these")
Response 6:
Let's first find the yearly revenue from selling 420 units every month for a year (12 months):
Revenue = 420 * Selling Price * 12

Now, the yearly profit is given by:

Profit = Revenue - Production Cost * Total number of components produced in the year
Profit = 12 * Selling Price * 420 - 110 * 12 * 420

We need to find the minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400:

12 * Selling Price * 420 - 110 * 12 * 420 >= 626400
Selling Price >= (626400 + 554400) / (12 * 420)
Selling Price >= 230

Question: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 24
  C: 25
  D: 40
  E: 52
Response 0:
Let's assume that the sales person makes "x" sales with a revenue of $250 each. The total revenue generated will be 250x. 

To calculate the commission earned, we need to find 10% of the total revenue, which is 0.1*(250x) = 25x.

The sales person earns a commission of 25x on "x" sales.

We need to find the value of "x" that will give the sales person a commission of at least $1000. 

So the equation will be:

25x >= 1000

x >= 40

Therefore, the salesperson needs to make at least 40 sales.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Solution:
Let's start by calculating the commission of one sale:
Commission = 10% of 250
Commission = 0.1 x 250
Commission = 25
Therefore, for every sale of $250, the sales person gets a commission of $25.

Now, let's determine how many sales of $250 the sales person must make to reach a salary of at least $1000:
Total commission = $1000
Number of sales = Total commission / Commission per sale
Number of sales = 1000 / 25
Number of sales = 40

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To calculate the number of sales, we need to first calculate the commission the sales person earns per sale.  
$250 x 10% = $25;  $1000 ÷ $25 = 40.  

Therefore, the sales person must make 40 sales to earn a salary of at least $1000.

To earn a salary of at least $1000, the sales person must earn $1000 in commission. Since he earns 10% commission on each sale he makes, he must make sales totaling $10,000 [(100% / 10%) x $1000]. 

To determine the number of sales of $250 each he must make, we divide $10,000 by $250:
$10,000 / $250 = 40

Therefore, the sales person must make 40 sales of $250 each to earn a salary of at least $1000.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let x be the number of sales:
 
0.1 * 250 * x = 1000
 
(0.1 * 250 * x)/250 = 1000/250
 
x = 4

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To earn $1000 salary, the sales person must make:
salary = commission * sales = 0.1 * sales * $250
$1000 = 0.1 * sales * $250
$1000 / $25 = sales
sales = 40

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let the number of sales that the salesperson makes be x. 
Then the commission earned on each sale is 10% of $250 = $25. 
The total commission earned for x sales is 25x. 
To earn a salary of at least $1000, the salesperson must have a total of 1000 + commission earned = 1000 + 25x, which gives us the equation 1000 + 25x >= total commission earned.
Simplifying the equation gives us 25x >= 750, which is equivalent to x >= 30.
Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 30 sales to earn a salary of at least $1000. 
Since the answer options do not include 30, we need to calculate the next highest number of sales that gives the salesperson a salary of at least $1000. 
The next highest number of sales is 4 more than 30, which is 34.

First, we need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute: 

12 miles per hour = 12/60 miles per minute = 0.2 miles per minute.

Then we can plug in the values: 

time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 240 minutes.

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We know that the unpainted side of the rectangle is 9 feet. Let's call the length of the rectangle "l" and the width "w". We know that the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can set up the equation: 

2l + w = 37

We also know that the unpainted side (w) is 9 feet, so we can substitute that into the equation: 

2l + 9 = 37

Solving for l: 

2l = 28
l = 14

So the length of the rectangle is 14 feet. 

To find the area of the rectangle, we multiply the length by the width: 

A = lw = 14 x 9 = 126

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C") - 126
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can start by using the information given to solve for the length and width of the parking space. Let's use L to represent the length and W to represent the width. We know that L + 2W = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides) and that W = 9 (the length of the unpainted side). Using these equations, we can solve for L: 

L + 2W = 37 
L + 2(9) = 37 
L + 18 = 37 
L = 19 

Now that we know the length and width of the parking space (19 feet and 9 feet, respectively), we can calculate the area by multiplying them together: 

Area = L × W = 19 × 9 = 171 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E") None of the Above. None of the answer choices provided is correct. The correct answer is 171 square feet.

Question: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 33
  C: 35
  D: 42
  E: 58
Response 0:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. Then, we have:

 (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23
 
Solving the above equation for x, we get:

 x = 69/38

So, the smaller number is 3x = 207/38 

Rationalizing the denominator, we get:

 207/38 = 5 and 17/38

Therefore, the answer is 5 and 17/38 or approximately 5.45.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. We are told that when 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. This means (3x-9):(5x-9) = 12:23. Now we can cross-multiply to get 23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9), which simplifies to 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Solving for x gives x=99/3=33. Therefore, the smaller of the two original numbers is 3x = 3(33) = 99.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x.
If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9.
We know that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23.
To solve for x, we cross-multiply and simplify: 23(3x-9) = 12(5x-9), which gives x=39.
Therefore, the smaller original number is 3x = 3(39) = 117.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x.
After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9.
According to the problem, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23.
Solving this equation, we get x = 69.
Therefore, the smaller number is 3x = 3*69 = 207.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, we have (3x-9) and (5x-9), respectively. We know that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Multiplying both sides by (5x-9) gives 3(5x-9) = 12(3x-9). Solving for x gives x = 11. Therefore, the smaller number is 3x - 9 = 24. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. We are given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Solving this equation yields x = 69. So the smaller number (3x) is 207. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. After subtracting 9 from each, the new numbers become 3x-9 and 5x-9. It is given that (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying and solving for x, we get x=69/16. Therefore, the smaller original number is 3x = 207/16.

Response 3:
Let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday.
Then since the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as on any other day, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday.
Since there are seven days in the week there are 7-1=6 other days, so the hotel buys 6x newspapers on the other days of the week.
From this, the total cost of newspapers per week is given by
4(2x) + 1(6x) = 210
Simplifying this expression gives 14x = 210, so x = 15.
Therefore the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
First, let X be the number of papers bought on Sunday. Then the number of papers bought on the other days of the week is X/2 papers per day. 

The cost of X Sunday papers is $4X and the cost of the papers on the other days of the week is $1(X/2)(6) = $3X. 

Thus, the total cost of the papers is:
$4X + $3X = $210

Solving the equation for X results in:
$7X = $210
X = 30

So the hotel buys 30 papers on Sunday, which means it buys 15 papers on Monday.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Let's start by defining some variables. Let d be the distance between X and Y and t be the time it takes for them to meet for the second time. 

During the time t/2, Allen travels from X to Y, a distance of d/2, and during the same time, Bob travels from Y to X, also a distance of d/2. 

During the time t/2, Allen's distance from X is increasing, and Bob's distance from Y is decreasing. Let a be the distance between Allen and Y and b be the distance between Bob and X. Then, we have:

a + b = d/2  (since they meet at the midpoint)
54 * (t/2 - a/54) = b  (since Bob's speed is faster than Allen's)
78 * (t/2 - b/78) = a  (since Allen's speed is faster than Bob's)

We also know that by the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen. This means that:

b + 48 = d/2 - a

We can now solve this system of equations for d:

a + b = d/2
54t - 54a = b
78t - 78b = a
b + 48 = d/2 - a

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and adding the fourth equation, we get:

2a + 2b + 96 = d

Substituting the first equation into the second and third equations, we get:

54t - 54(d/2 - b) = b
78t - 78b = d/2 - b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

b = 27t - 27d/4
156t = 39d

Substituting these into the equation for a + b, we get:

a + 27t - 27d/4 = d/2

Substituting the equation for b into the equation for a + b, we get:

a + 27t - 27d/4 + 27t - 27d/4 + 96 = d/2
54t - 27d/2 + 96 = d/2
54t - 13.5d + 96 = d/2

Substituting the equation for d/4 from the equation for b, we get:

54t - 13.5(4t) + 96 = d/2
54t - 54t + 96 = d/2
d = 192 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 192 km. 

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")  144km
Response 2:
Let us assume Allen started from point X and Bob started from point Y. Let us also assume that the distance between X and Y be "D" kilometers.
When they first meet, let "t" be the time in hours since they started moving.
At their first meeting, the distance traveled by Allen would be 54t and similarly, the distance traveled by Bob would be 78t.
Since they started from opposite points, their total distance covered would be D. So, the distance that they still need to cover to meet for the first time would be (D - 54t - 78t) km for Allen and (D - 78t - 54t) km for Bob.
Both Allen and Bob is moving towards each other when they meet for the first time. So, we can add those two distances to form an equation that represents their first meeting as  D = 132t.
Let us assume the second meeting be "t2" kilometers away from the first meeting point. Therefore, the distance Bob traveled at the second meeting would be (D + 48) km.
Using the equation we got from the first meeting, t2 can be written in terms of t.
t2 = D - 132t
At this second meeting, Allen has traveled a total of 2D - t2 kilometers (he went from Y to X then back to Y), and he would have traveled at a constant speed of 54kph.
Bob has traveled a total of D + 48 kilometers at the second meeting and he would have traveled at a constant speed of 78kph.
Since both Allen and Bob meet each other again at the same time in this scenario, we can set up an equation where the distance they cover is equal to each other. That is:
2D - t2 = D + 48
Substitute t2 with D - 132t 
2D -(D - 132t) = D + 48
D - 132t = 48
D = 48 + 132t
Substitute into the equation we got from the first meeting, D = 132t, we obtain
132t = 48 + 132t
t = 4
Substitute t = 4 into the equation D = 132t, we get
D = 528 km

Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is 'd'. Also, let t be the time taken for Bob and Allen to meet for the first time. 

When they meet for the first time, they cover a total distance of 'd'. The relative speed between them is 54+78 = 132 kmph.

Hence, d = 132t. 

When they meet for the second time the effective relative speed will now be the sum of their speeds i.e. 54+78 = 132 kmph since they are now moving towards each other.  Let's assume that this time they meet after a time 't2' after their second start. 

The distance covered by Allen from Y to the meeting point in the first meeting is (54*t) km. In the time 't2' Allen will cover (54*t2) km. Hence the distance between Y and the meeting point after they start moving from X and Y respectively for the second time is (d - 54t - 54t2) km.

The distance covered by Bob is (78*t) km until the first meeting point, and in the time 't2' he covers (78*t2) km. Hence, the distance between X and the second meeting point is (d - 78t - 78t2) km.

It is given that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen until they meet for the second time. Therefore,

78t + 78t2 = 54t + 54t2 + 48
24t + 24t2 = 16
3t + 3t2 = 2
Now, we have two equations in two variables:
d = 132t
d - 54t - 54t2 = d - 78t - 78t2 + 48

Simplifying the second equation we get:
24t + 39t2 = 8

Simplifying the first equation we have:
d = 132t

We can substitute t from the second equation into the first one and find d:
d = 132(2-3t2)/3

Simplifying the equation we get d = 84 km.

Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let's assume "x" is the number of days to cover the lake when starting with 64 lilies.  

Initially, there are 64 water lilies on the lake, which doubles every two days. So the equation becomes:  

Day 0: 64 lilies  
Day 2: 128 lilies  
Day 4: 256 lilies  
Day 6: 512 lilies  
...  
Day x: 64 * 2^(x/2) lilies  

We know that it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is exactly one water lily on the lake. So, we can set up the following equation:  

60 days: 1 water lily = 64 * 2^(60/2) water lilies  

x days: 64 water lilies = 64 * 2^(x/2) water lilies  

Now, we can solve for "x":  

64 * 2^(x/2) = 64 * 2^(60/2)  
2^(x/2) = 2^30  
x/2 = 30  
x = 60  

Therefore, starting with 64 lilies, it will take 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies.

sum of weights of 10 vehicles = 122 

When the heavy duty truck was added, there are 11 vehicles with an average weight of (12.2+2.6) = 14.8 tons: 

(sum of weights of 10 vehicles) + X = 14.8 * 11 

122 + X = 162.8 

X = 40.8

Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let the share of each nephew be Rs x. 
Then, the share of each daughter is Rs 4x, and 
the share of each son is Rs 5x. 
Therefore, the total amount

5 * 5x + 4 * 4x + 2 * x = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200
 
Hence, each daughter receives Rs 800
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's first calculate the amount received by each nephew.
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter gets 4x.
Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son gets 5x.
There are 4 daughters and 5 sons, so their total share is 4*4x + 5*5x = 61x.
The total amount to be divided is Rs 8600, so we have 61x = 8600.
Thus, x = 140.

So, each daughter receives 4 times x, which is Rs 560.

Therefore, the Answer is Action: Answer("B") which is Rs 500.
Response 4:
Let the amount of each nephew be x.
Then, amount received by each daughter = 4x
And amount received by each son = 5x

Total number of parts= 5+4+2 = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600

So, [(5*5x) + (4*4x) + (2*x)] = 8600
Simplifying the above equation, we get x=200.

Hence, each daughter receives 800.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and share of each son = 5x.

Now,  Total amount = 8600

Total number of shares = 5+4+2=11

Therefore, 11x = 8600

Hence, the value of x = 8600/11 =  781.8

Thus, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4 x 781.8 = Rs 3127.2

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let the amount each nephew receives be "x".
Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
The total number of people receiving money is 5+4+2=11.
So, we have the equation 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600.
Solving for x, we get x=200.
Therefore, each daughter will receive 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x
Then each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x
Total number of people receiving the amount = 5+4+2=11
Total amount = 8600
Amount received by each daughter = 4x
So, the equation becomes: 
5x + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Solving for x: x = 400
Amount received by each daughter = 4x = Rs 1600

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then,
Share of each son = 5x
Share of each daughter = 4(share of each nephew) = 4x

Total number of children = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total share = Rs 8600

We can create an equation:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Solving for x, we get:

x = 200

So, each daughter receives Rs 4x = Rs 800

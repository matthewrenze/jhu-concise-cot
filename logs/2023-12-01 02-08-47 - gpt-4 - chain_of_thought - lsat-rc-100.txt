Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought process:
- Passage A talks about rivalry and people being happy when they make more money than others, which could be seen as misguided behavior.
- Passage B suggests that wanting to make more money is not just about having more than others, but about wanting to create value, which can be seen as admirable.
- The correct answer should have Passage A's term first and Passage B's term second.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  In passage A, a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors would be described as someone affected by rivalry and habituation, in terms of their happiness. The authors highlight the idea that people are mainly driven by relative comparisons to their reference group, rather than absolute wealth.

  In passage B, the authors argue that wanting to have more than others is due to the desire to create value and be successful. It isn't about one-upmanship, but rather about feeling valuable. So, based on this perspective, the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors would be seen as someone with a desire to create value and be successful.

  Looking at the choices, the terms that most likely fit the descriptions from passage A and passage B respectively are:

  D: misguided, admirable

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
Passage A discusses habituation and rivalry as factors contributing to people's desire for more income and the effect on happiness. It describes a situation where a person would choose to make less money as long as their relative position improved. This implies that the person may be misguided in their pursuit of happiness through wealth.

Passage B argues that a higher income provides happiness due to the feeling of success and value creation, rather than just having more money. The passage suggests that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness, which can be seen as admirable.

Therefore, the pair of terms that would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors are "misguided" and "admirable."

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  In passage A, the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors might be described as misguided because it explains the effect of rivalry on happiness, showing that people are happier when they have a higher relative position, even if they're poorer.
  
  In passage B, the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors might be described as admirable because the passage argues that the desire to create value, demonstrated through wealth, is beneficial for society and brings happiness.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thoughts:
- Passage A discusses the effects of rivalry on happiness and describes the example of people preferring to earn less money if their relative position within their reference group improves. This suggests a somewhat misguided focus on comparison rather than absolute income.
- Passage B argues that people who earn more view themselves as successful, which in turn leads to happiness. The desire to create value is seen as something positive, and as a result, the pursuit of higher income than one's neighbors could be considered admirable.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the phenomena of habituation and rivalry, with rivalry being shown as people wanting to make more money relative to their "reference group." The passage used the example of the Solnick and Hemenway study to illustrate that people would choose a lower overall income if it resulted in a higher relative position within their group. This suggests that the author of passage A might describe such a person as "misguided" in the sense that they prioritize relative wealth over actual income.

  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that the desire for more money could be interpreted as a desire for success and creating value. The author implies that the need to be more prosperous than others is a positive motivation that benefits society as a whole. Therefore, the author of passage B might describe such a person as "admirable" since they see the desire as a sign of wanting to create value.

  Hence, the choice that corresponds to these descriptions is D: misguided (passage A), admirable (passage B).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about rivalry and how people chose to have higher income compared to their reference group, even if it means being poorer in total. This could be seen as "misguided."
  Passage B suggests that wanting to make more money is a sign of a desire to create value, which is beneficial to society and brings happiness. This point of view might consider such a person as "admirable."
  Based on these descriptions, the correct answer is D: misguided, admirable.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A emphasizes the role of rivalry and comparisons with reference groups in people's pursuit of increased income. It suggests people's desires for wealth might be misaligned due to habituation and rivalry, which could make one consider their motivation as misguided.

  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are doing so to demonstrate their value creation rather than simple one-upmanship. It states that wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness. This portrayal can be considered admirable.

  Based on the context of both passages, the authors would likely use the terms from choice D: misguided (passage A) and admirable (passage B).
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  In passage A, the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is likely to be described as misguided because it mentions that people do not foresee how they adjust to material possessions, and they tend to overinvest in acquiring them at the expense of leisure.
  
  In passage B, the author suggests that wanting to make more money than one's neighbors is not because of an ignoble tendency but because of the desire to create value. The person might be considered admirable since their actions are driven by the pursuit of creating value and not just material wealth.

  Hence, the correct choice is D: misguided, admirable.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought Process:
- In passage A, a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is described as someone who is affected by rivalry and habituation (wanting to improve their relative position). The term that best matches this mindset is "misguided."
- In passage B, the author argues that people want to earn more money because it makes them feel successful and valuable. The term that would most likely be used by the author of passage B to describe someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors is "admirable" because the author believes this desire benefits society.
- Therefore, the correct answer is the pair of terms "misguided" and "admirable."

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Based on what can be inferred from their titles, the relationship between the documents in which one of the following pairs Js most ,analogpus to the relationship between passage A and passage B?
Choices:
  A: Cameras in the Courtroom: A Perversion of Justice? "The Pros and Cons of Televising Courtroom regard as trivial.Proceedings"
  B: Cameras in the Courtroom: Three Central Issues in the Debate "The Unexpected Benefits of Permitting Cameras in Court"
  C: The Inherent Dangers of Permitting Cameras in Court "How Televising Courtroom Proceedings Can Assist the Law"
  D: The Troublesome History of Cameras in the Courtroom "The Laudable Motives Behind Televised courtroom, Proceedings"
  E: Why Cameras Should Be Banned from the Courtroom "The Inevitability of Televised Courtroom Proceedings"
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A addresses problems posed by jury nullification and criticizes it.
  Passage B describes the positive aspects of jury nullification and argues in favor of it.
  The relationship between the two passages is that one criticizes an issue (jury nullification), while the other points out positive aspects of the same issue.
  
  A: One passage criticizes cameras in the courtroom and the other discusses pros and cons. This one could be a possible choice.
  B: One passage discusses three central issues, and the other passage explains the benefits of cameras in court. This choice does not mirror the relationship between Passage A and B.
  C: One passage explains the dangers of permitting cameras in court and the other passage explains how it can assist the law. This choice does mirror the relationship between Passage A and B.
  D: One passage discusses the troublesome history and the other focuses on the laudable motives behind it. This choice does not mirror the relationship between a Passage A and B.
  E: One passage argues for banning cameras from the courtroom, and the other discusses the inevitability of televised courtroom proceedings. This choice does not mirror the relationship between Passage A and B.
  
  Based on the relationship between Passage A and B, the most analogous choice would be the one that contains two related passages with one criticizing an issue and the other pointing out positive aspects of the same issue. Choices A and C best fit this scenario.
  
  Comparing A and C: 
  A: One passage criticizes cameras in the courtroom, and the other passage presents both pros and cons. This choice is close to the relationship between Passage A and B but also adds the element of presenting both pros and cons, which is not present in Passage B's relationship to Passage A.
  C: One passage highlights the dangers of permitting cameras in court, and the other passage explains how it can help the law. This choice closely mirrors the relationship between Passage A and B.

  It seems that choice C better represents the relationship between Passage A and B, as one passage criticizes the issue and the other highlights the positive aspects.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A focuses on issues and problems created by jury nullification, meaning it takes a more critical view.
  Passage B shows how jury nullification can help the legal system, acting as a safety valve, and might be seen as a positive take on the issue.
  
  We need to find a pair of titles that follow this relationship: one taking a critical view and the other a more positive one.

Choices Analysis:
  A: This option seems to fit the criterion as one title (A) presents a critical view, while the other (B) discusses the pros and cons.
  B: This option does not match the criterion, as one title (A) presents a debate, and the other (B) focuses on benefits.
  C: This option follows the criterion with one title (A) being critical and the other (B) illustrating an advantageous perspective.
  D: Here, both titles (A and B) have a positive undertone and don't match the criterion.
  E: This option also does not match the criterion, as both titles (A and B) have a negative stance towards the topic.

The best match for the relationship between Passage A and Passage B seems to be option C.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:

Passage A discusses problems and arguments against jury nullification, while Passage B addresses the possible benefits and positive aspects of jury nullification.

So we are looking for a pair of titles where one presents a negative view or problems of a topic while the other presents positive aspects or benefits of the same topic.

- Choice A presents disadvantages of cameras in the courtroom and pros and cons, which do not seem to align well with the passages.
- Choice B discusses central issues and possible benefits, which differ from the passages.
- Choice C presents dangers and potential assistance provided by the topic, which seems to be a more fitting analogy to the passages' relationship.
- Choice D discusses a troublesome history and laudable motives, which is close, but it may not align as well as Choice C.
- Choice E presents a call for banning cameras and inevitability, which is not similar to the passages' relationship.

Considering the analysis so far, Choice C seems to be the most analogous to the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thoughts: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification and is generally critical of the practice.
  Passage B presents the positive aspects of jury nullification, showcasing its role as a safety valve and assisting the legislature, which means it has a more positive view of the practice.
  We have to find a pair of titles with a similar relationship, where one is critical, and the other is either positive or highlights the positive aspects of a particular subject.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
Passage A presents the problems created by jury nullification, while Passage B presents the positive aspects and usefulness of jury nullification. The relationship between the two passages is that they present opposing views regarding the same issue.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A presents the problems associated with jury nullification.
  Passage B discusses the potential benefits and positive functions of jury nullification.
  
  We need to find a pair of titles that present opposing views or interpretations of their common topic, much like Passages A and B.
  
  A: The first title questions whether cameras in the courtroom are a perversion of justice, while the second title discusses the pros and cons, including more neutral view. This option seems close.
  
  B: The first title introduces the central issues in the debate, while the second title highlights unexpected benefits, suggesting a more positive perspective. This option seems close as well.
  
  C: The first title discusses the inherent dangers of cameras in court, while the second title explains how televising court proceedings can assist the law. This option represents opposing views, so it is a strong candidate.
  
  D: The first title talks about the troublesome history of cameras in the courtroom, while the second title focuses on laudable motives behind the practice. This option seems close.
  
  E: The first title argues why cameras should be banned, while the second title discusses the inevitability of televised court proceedings. This option could be considered, but it doesn't directly oppose the first title's viewpoint as strongly as other options.
  
  Among all the given choices, Option C represents the most analogous relationship to Passages A and B, as they both present directly opposing views on their shared topic.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A mainly highlights problems created by jury nullification.
  Passage B, on the other hand, shows some positive aspects of jury nullification.
  Thus, the relationship between the two passages is that one highlights the negative aspects while the other highlights the positive aspects of the same issue.
  
  Now, comparing the given choices:
  A: Perversion vs. Pros and Cons - This pair seems to be an argument against vs. a balanced view.
  B: Three Central Issues vs. Unexpected Benefits - This pair seems to be identifying key issues vs. discussing positive aspects.
  C: Inherent Dangers vs. How It Can Assist - This pair seems to highlight the negative aspects vs. the positive aspects.
  D: Troublesome History vs. Laudable Motives - This pair seems to discuss historical problems vs. the intentions behind it.
  E: Why They Should Be Banned vs. Inevitability - This pair seems to be discussing reasons against vs. the unavoidability of the issue.

  Based on the comparison, choice C best captures the relationship between Passage A and Passage B, as it highlights the negative aspects of the issue in one document and the positive aspects in the other document.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A mainly focuses on the problems created by jury nullification.
  Passage B discusses the possible benefits of discretion and jury nullification in criminal cases.
  The relationship between these passages involves two different perspectives on jury nullification: one highlighting the problems and the other showcasing potential benefits.

Option Analysis:
  A: The first title implies that cameras in the courtroom are a perversion of justice. The second title focuses on the pros and cons, considering both negative and positive aspects. This option does not match the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
  
  B: The first title highlights three central issues in the debate, suggesting a more comprehensive discussion. The second title focuses on the unexpected benefits of cameras in court. This option does not match the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
  
  C: The first title focuses on inherent dangers, while the second title discusses how televising proceedings can assist the law. This option reflects the relationship between Passage A and Passage B, which covers the problems and possible benefits of jury nullification.
  
  D: The first title mentions the troublesome history, while the second title emphasizes laudable motives. This option does not focus on the problems and benefits specifically, as Passage A and Passage B do.
  
  E: The first title advocates for banning cameras, while the second title discusses the inevitability of televised proceedings. This option's emphasis on inevitability does not match the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.

Based on the analysis above, the relationship between the titles in option C is most analogous to the relationship between Passage A and Passage B.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A points out the problems created by jury nullification.
  Passage B argues the usefulness of jury nullification and how it can assist the legislature.

  The relationship between these two passages seems like one passage points out the issues or dangers, and the other passage talks about its benefits or how it can help.

  Let's analyze the choices and see which pair has the most analogous relationship.

  A: One passage questions the perversion of justice, while the other passage lists pros and cons. Not quite similar.
  
  B: One passage focuses on the issues in the debate, while the other discusses benefits. This looks like a potential match.
  
  C: One passage talks about inherent dangers, while the other discusses how the subject can assist the law. This also looks like a potential match.
  
  D: One passage focuses on the troublesome history, while the other highlights the laudable motives. The relationship is about the past while the other is about the intention, not very similar.
  
  E: One passage argues for banning cameras, while the other talks about inevitability. This is not quite similar.

  The most analogous relationship seems to be between choices B and C, as one passage talks about the issues or dangers, and the other passage discusses benefits or assistance provided by the subject. In this case, choice B focuses more on the debate, while choice C is more directly about the dangers and how it can assist the law. Thus, choice C is a better match.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
- Passage A focuses on the problems created by jury nullification.
- Passage B presents the potential benefits of jury nullification.

We are looking for a pair of titles that reflect a similar relationship between two opposing views.

- A: One title questions the justice of cameras in the courtroom, while the other discusses the pros and cons. This could be an option.
- B: One title discusses issues in the debate, and the other talks about benefits. This could be an option.
- C: One title focuses on dangers, and the other on how it can assist the law. This seems like a good match.
- D: One title discusses a troublesome history, while the other talks about laudable motives. This could be an option.
- E: One title advocates for banning cameras, while the other talks about the inevitability of televised proceedings. This does not seem to match as well as other options.

Answer: After considering the similarities between the titles and how they reflect opposing views, "C" seems to have the closest relationship to the passages.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Thought process:
- The passage explains that secondary substances in plants are not required for their growth/functioning, but they play a role in attracting or repelling insects.
- Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects, and others deter insects from feeding on the plants, which benefits the plants.
- Insects evolve to circumvent plant defenses, allowing them to access plants for food sources.

Choice Analysis:
  A: The passage supports that some chemicals (secondary substances) play a role in attracting or repelling insects, which is essential for the plant's survival.
  B: The passage states that fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources, but it does not state that most plants' defense systems are bypassed by a wide variety of insects.
  C: The passage does not discuss insects identifying plants through other means than taste or smell.
  D: The passage talks about secondary substances arising from mutations and natural selection, but it does not state that they evolved independently in unrelated species of plants.
  E: The passage does not discuss toxic substances evolving together with secondary substances but not being secondary substances themselves.

From the analysis of the given choices, A seems to be the most supported by the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:

- The passage does not focus on unrelated species of plants, nor does it discuss other means of identification besides taste and smell for insects.

From this information, the statement with the most support is:

A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage states that secondary substances play a role in attracting pollinating insects or providing defense against plant-eating insects. It also discusses how insects have evolved to identify plants by their characteristic tastes or smells. Additionally, it explains that some secondary substances are harmful to insects, while others warn against harmful substances. The passage provides information about the evolution of secondary substances in plants and their role in the interaction between plants and insects.

 Analysis of choices:
  A: The passage states that some secondary substances attract pollinating insects or protect plants from their enemies. This implies that they play a vital role in the life of plants.
  B: The passage mostly focuses on how insects have evolved to identify and overcome the plants' defenses. It does not provide enough information to support that most plants with chemical defenses are used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  C: The passage does not provide information about insects identifying plants by means other than taste or smell. Therefore, this choice is not supported.
  D: The passage does state that secondary substances evolved independently but does not mention that they survived in only a few species.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought process:
Let's go through each choice and find a quote or reasoning from the passage to support the choice.

A: The passage states that some secondary substances "give plants their distinctive tastes and smells" and that they can act as "biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects." This implies that these secondary substances, while not involved in the plant's growth or metabolism, still play a vital role in their lives. So, choice A is supported by the passage.

B: The passage doesn't provide enough information about the variety of insects that use plants as food to make a supportive statement for choice B.

C: The passage states that "insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both." There's no support for the idea that insects have other identification means apart from taste or smell in the passage.

D: There is no information in the passage that suggests that many secondary substances evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but survived in only a few species.

E: The passage doesn't specifically mention any correlation between toxic substances and secondary substances, nor does it mention any other type of substances that evolved alongside secondary substances.

Therefore, the best choice is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage explains that secondary substances in plants provide them with distinctive tastes and smells. Some benefit plants by attracting pollinating insects while others defend against plant-eating insects. Insects that can circumvent these defenses come to prefer those plants and evolve to identify them by their flavors or odors. This evolutionary competition has led insects to become associated with narrowly defined and botanically restricted groups of plants.

Considering the provided choices, the information from the passage can be used to infer:
A: Some chemicals (secondary substances) not directly involved in plant growth play vital roles (defending against insects and attracting pollinators) in the lives of plants.
This matches the information from the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and help them in the evolutionary competition against insects. It states that some secondary substances attract pollinating insects, while others act as defenses against plant-eating insects. Insect species have become associated with narrowly defined groups of plants due to this competition. Therefore, it is implied that some chemicals not directly involved in plant growth or metabolism play crucial roles in plants' lives.
  
  The answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage focuses on the idea that as the size of a business or operation increases, the efficiency and productivity of the workers or processes will also increase, resulting in greater output per worker or input. The key to identifying the correct answer is finding an example where an increase in size or scale directly leads to greater efficiency and specialization, leading to increased productivity per worker or per input.

  Choice A: The publishing house improves productivity but reduces the number of editors. This does not directly relate to increasing returns to scale or size.

  Choice B: The bee colony can use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, leading to increased productivity among the other bees as they focus on processing the nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale, as the growth of the bee colony allows for increased efficiency and specialization among the bees, leading to increased productivity.

  Choice C: The school district only switches to year-round operation without mentioning increased efficiency or specialization.

  Choice D: The lobster industry's increase in catches is a result of advances in technology, not an increase in size or scale.

Analysis:
  A: This choice describes an improvement in productivity due to relaxed standards and employing fewer editors. It doesn't illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  B: This choice shows how a large bee colony can better divide up the work and collect more nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the colony's size allows it to specialize its workers to improve productivity.
  C: This choice describes a change in operation that increases the capacity of the school building, but it doesn't address increasing returns to scale in terms of specialized workers.
  D: This choice deals with technological advances improving productivity in the lobster industry, not increasing returns to scale based on the size of the organization or specialized workers.
  E: This choice describes the growth of ant colonies, but it doesn't specifically address increasing returns to scale due to specialization of workers in larger organizations.

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes the sign for "sheep" as an abstract symbol, not as a pictograph.
  It does not say that the sign for "sheep" is unique or could not be replaced by any other unused sign.
  It also does not discuss the political life of the people who used cuneiform or claim that the way the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning was not studied before Schmandt-Besserat.
  So, we can eliminate choices B, D, and E.

  The best answer is A: "It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else." This statement acknowledges the abstract nature of the sign and suggests that it is not inherently tied to the meaning of "sheep."

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text mentions that the sign for sheep is a circled cross. This is an abstract symbol rather than a pictograph. The passage focuses on the evolution of abstract symbols in cuneiform writing. The author describes Denise Schmandt-Besserat's theory about the transition between tokens and written marks.
  
  Choice A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  There is no information in the passage to support or refute this claim.

  Choice B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  Contrary to this statement, both signs are described as abstract symbols, and they follow a similar way of carrying the meaning.

  Choice C: The way in which it represents its meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  The passage focuses on the development of abstract symbols, but it does not discuss the motives behind the specific symbol for "sheep."

  Choice D: The way it represents its meaning was not the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to that given by Schmandt-Besserat.
  The passage doesn't mention whether the sign for sheep itself received scientific scrutiny prior to Schmandt-Besserat's work. It only mentions that the tokens were largely ignored by archaeologists until her research.

  Choice E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing.
  The passage does not discuss how the abstract symbols are related to the political life of the people.

The author would most likely agree with the statement in choice A that "It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else." as it is consistent with the nature of abstract symbols.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The passage talks about the appearance of abstract symbols in cuneiform writings, and uses the example of the sign for "sheep" as a circled cross, rather than a pictographic representation. 
- The passage discusses Denise Schmandt-Besserat's theory, suggesting the tokens evolved into the written form, and eventually leading to the development of more abstract and flexible written forms.

Analyzing each choice:

A: The passage does not suggest that the sign for "sheep" could be replaced without losing its significance. It only mentions it as an example of abstract writing.
B: The passage does not indicate that the sign for "sheep" has a different meaning than the sign for "metal." It merely mentions both as examples of abstract symbols.
C: The passage does not link the representation of the sign for "sheep" to its agricultural nature. It only uses the symbol as an example of abstract writing.
D: The passage does not talk specifically about Schmandt-Besserat studying the "sheep" sign; instead, it mentions her work on the token system as a whole that eventually evolved into written forms.
E: The passage does not discuss political life related to the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep." The focus is on the development of written forms.

Considering the information in the passage, the author is most likely to agree with choice A. The sign for "sheep" is an example of abstract writing, and its specific form is not crucial to the discussion; the main point is its abstract nature.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep but rather a circled cross, which is an abstract representation. It does not mention any specific reasons why this sign was chosen or any specifics about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing.

  Choice A implies that the sign's meaning could be replaced with any other unused sign without losing its significance. This idea is plausible because the passage does not specify any inherent connection between the sign and its meaning.

  Choice B compares the cuneiform sign for "sheep" and "metal," stating that they get their meanings in radically different ways. The passage does not provide enough information on how these signs get their meanings, so it's not possible to support this statement.

  Choice C suggests that the representation of the sign for "sheep" was because sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry. The passage does not support this idea, and it does not make this distinction for the sign.

  Choice D claims that the way the sign represents its meaning was not a subject of scientific scrutiny before Schmandt-Besserat. The passage does not mention any previous studies or scrutiny regarding the sign for "sheep."

  Choice E states that the abstract nature of the sign reveals much about the political life of the people who used uniform writing. The passage does not support this idea; it does not mention any connection between the abstract signs and political life.

  Based on the passage, Choice A seems the most plausible statement regarding the sign for "sheep."

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross (line 6), which implies that it is an abstract symbol. The passage does not provide any information to support choices B, C, D, and E. Choice A is the closest to the information provided in the passage, suggesting that the sign's abstract nature means it could potentially be replaced by other unused signs without loss of significance.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the sign for "sheep" is an abstract symbol (a circled cross) rather than a pictograph. This indicates that the sign is not a direct image of the object it represents. The passage does not mention any specific characteristics or scientific scrutiny about the sign for "sheep". The statement that aligns the most with the passage's information about the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep" is A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else since it's not a direct image of the object it represents. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thoughts: 
- The passage describes cuneiform writing and uses the example of the sign for "sheep" as an abstract symbol instead of a pictograph.
- Schmandt-Besserat's work traced the development of abstract signs/annotations from tokens, which led to the rise of cuneiform writing.
- There is no information about political life or the scarcity of scientific scrutiny in the passage.

Analyzing choices:
A: The passage does not mention that the sign for "sheep" is interchangeable with other symbols.
B: The passage compares the "sheep" and "metal" symbols as examples of abstract signs in cuneiform writing, not radically different.
C: The passage does not provide information about the agricultural or industrial nature of the symbols as the reason for their representation.
D: The passage does not discuss the level of scientific scrutiny given to the "sheep" symbol before Schmandt-Besserat's work.
E: The passage does not discuss anything about the political life of the people using the language.

Eliminating choices:
- Choice E: Unrelated to the political life.
- Choice D: No mention of the level of scientific scrutiny before Schmandt-Besserat's work.
- Choice C: No information about the agricultural or industrial nature affecting the representation.
- Choice B: The passage compares the "sheep" and "metal" symbols as examples of abstract signs; not radically different.

That leaves us with choice A:
A: Although not directly stated, it can be inferred that the abstract nature of cuneiform writing allows for various abstract symbols to represent a concept, as the way these symbols are written had shifted from pictographs to abstract symbols. In that sense, if the sign for "sheep" were replaced by another unused abstract sign, the meaning would not have been lost.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions the sign for "sheep" as a circled cross, which is an abstract symbol and not an image of a sheep. The focus of this detail is the abstract nature of the symbol. Choice A, mentioning that this sign could be replaced by another unused sign, matches the context of the passage focus on the abstract nature of the symbol for "sheep."

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that the sign for "sheep" is a circled cross and not an image of a sheep, indicating that it is an abstract symbol. The author does not mention any specific reason for using this particular symbol or any specific connection to the political life of people. Also, the passage does not state that the sign's meaning was not studied before Schmandt-Besserat or that it could have been replaced by any other sign. There is no mention of the sign for "sheep" getting its meaning differently from the sign for "metal." 

  Given this information, none of the answer choices align perfectly with the author's opinion. However, we must choose the best of the available options.

  Choice A states that the sign could be replaced without loss of significance, which might be true, but there is no specific indication in the passage that the author would agree with this statement.

  Choice B states that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning differently than the sign for "metal." However, the passage does not provide enough information about the meaning of these signs to support this statement.

  Choice C states that the sign representing "sheep" comes from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry. While this might be a reasonable assumption, the passage does not provide any information for the author to agree with this statement.

  Choice D suggests that the sign's meaning was not the subject of scientific scrutiny before Schmandt-Besserat. While the passage does not specifically mention this, it is somewhat implied by mentioning Schmandt-Besserat's findings and not mentioning any prior research related to the sign for sheep in particular.

  Choice E talks about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing. There is no information in the passage about the political life of these people.

  Among the available options, D seems to be the best choice, as it relates to Schmandt-Besserat's research and implies that prior scrutiny of the sign for sheep has not been mentioned in the passage.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the appearance of abstract writing in cuneiform and mentions an example, the sign for "sheep". The sign is not an image of a sheep but a circled cross. This indicates that the sign is abstract. Analyzing the answer choices with regards to this information:

  A: The passage doesn't provide information about whether the sign could be replaced by another sign without losing its meaning.
  B: The passage also describes the sign for "metal" as abstract, not distinguishing the way they get their meaning.
  C: The passage doesn't specifically mention the reason for the sign's representation based on sheep being an agricultural commodity.
  D: The passage doesn't mention Schmandt-Besserat's direct involvement in the study of the sign for "sheep".
  E: The passage mainly discusses the writing and evolution of the written form and doesn't give any details about the political life of the people who used the language.

  From these thoughts, it seems that choice B is the most consistent with the author's view on the sign for "sheep".

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Both Passage A and Passage B discuss the relationship between neuroscience and the concept of free will. They explore the implications of neuroscience research on freedom of the will and its effects on human behavior. These passages are not directly concerned with other aspects like punishment, deterrence, retribution, or causation.
  
  So, they are mainly concerned with answering B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's third position is contrary to the radical critics' view, who demand for art to be useful and reflect concrete reality.
  Dostoyevsky believes that a literary work must stand on its "artistic merit" and that artistry is the ability to write well.
  This means, if the radical critics recognize the importance of artistic merit in evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude towards their views would be softened.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky took issue with the radical critics for their insistence that art must serve a particular political view, and he believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." The passage states that Dostoyevsky strongly disagreed with the utilitarian view that formal aspects were of secondary importance, and he believed that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. His view of reality going deeper than the radical critics also hints that he might soften his stance if they acknowledged the importance of artistic merit.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's perspectives on the role of art and reality in literature compared to the radical critics' view.
  The passage also states that Dostoyevsky believed in the importance of artistic merit, which should stand regardless of political views.
  The radical critics wanted art to be useful and often prioritized political causes above artistic qualities. 
  If the radical critics were to recognize the importance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, it may soften Dostoyevsky's attitude.
  Thus, option D is the most appropriate answer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky took issue with the radical critics' insistence that art serves a specific political view and their utilitarian claim that formal aspects were secondary to the goal of a work.
  He believed that artistic merit was essential and only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
  If the radical critics recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view and believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit." He defined artistry as the ability to write well in characters and images to express the author's thoughts. The passage also mentions that the utilitarian claim of formal aspects being secondary was a contradiction according to Dostoyevsky.

  To soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view, they would need to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's view falls between the two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  His understanding of reality goes beyond tangible elements, merging reality and fantasy.
  He disagrees with radical critics assigning a "shameful destiny" to art as only serving a political view.
  Dostoyevsky believes a work should stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  Considering Dostoyevsky's beliefs, he would most likely soften his attitude if the radical critics acknowledged the full significance of artistic merit.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' demand that art must serve a particular political view and their insistence that art must be "useful" to society.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand on its "artistic merit" and the utilitarian claim for works being of secondary importance did not make sense to him.
  If the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude towards their view would likely be softened.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view and their emphasis on the work's usefulness. Dostoyevsky believed a literary work's value should be based on its artistic merit. Therefore, his attitude towards the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

  The correct answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's main disagreement with the radical critics is their insistence that literature should only serve a political or practical purpose and that formal aspects are secondary.
  He believes that literature should be judged on its artistic merit and that true usefulness cannot always be measured.
  If the radical critics recognize the importance of artistic merit, it would soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's attitude would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the importance of artistic merit rather than focusing solely on the usefulness of art. This is indicated in the text where Dostoyevsky explains his definition of an "artistic" novelist and how he sees artistry as the ability to write well. The passage also mentions the radical critics' utilitarian claim of prioritizing the work's purpose over its formal aspects, which Dostoyevsky sees as a contradiction.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Katherine Dunham transformed the field of anthropology by developing innovative research methodologies for studying Caribbean and other traditional dance styles and connecting them with African American dance.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The assertion in lines 11-16 states that none of the African American writers used a musical genre as the entire structuring principle for a novel, until Toni Morrison's Jazz. If any of the choices suggest that someone else had attempted to structure their work based on a musical genre before Toni Morrison, the assertion would be called into question.

Choices Analysis:
  A: This choice acknowledges that Jazz has a jazz performance style narration, but it doesn't challenge the assertion.
  B: This choice implies that African American novelists have attempted to structure their work based on blues music, which contradicts the assertion that no one had done something similar before Toni Morrison.
  C: This choice doesn't specifically address African American writers or structuring their work based on a musical genre.
  D: This choice is a general statement about the musical nature of novels but does not address the assertion.
  E: This choice talks about the number of African American writers who write about music but doesn't mention a novel structured based on a musical genre.

Answer: The author's assertion would be most called into question if choice B were true, as it suggests that a small number of African American novelists had already attempted to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.

Action: Answer("B")

  B: This choice suggests earlier African American novelists were influenced by another music genre (blues), but it doesn't affect the uniqueness of Morrison's novel based on jazz.
  C: This choice would challenge the uniqueness of Morrison's novel by asserting that all novels about nonliterary arts share a similar trait, making "Jazz" not as unique as the author claims.
  D: While this choice mentions novels having musical nature, it doesn't challenge the uniqueness of the structure of "Jazz."
  E: This choice comments on the number of authors who have written about music but does not address the unique structuring of "Jazz."

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is about African American writers using musicians and music as themes and metaphors in their writing before Toni Morrison's "Jazz" and no one had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for a novel.
If any of the options show a writer drawing upon a musical genre before Jazz, then the author's assertion would be called into question.

Option A doesn't challenge the author's assertion, as it simply confirms the connection to jazz in Morrison's novel.

Option B states that other African American novelists tried to base their work on blues music's structure before Jazz. This option would call the author's assertion into question, suggesting that other writers had attempted a similar approach before Morrison.

Option C does not specifically refer to African American literature or novels utilizing a musical genre as a structuring principle.

Option D suggests that any novel can be somewhat musical, but does not conflict with the assertion specifically about African American novels using a musical genre as a structuring principle.

Option E talks about African American writers overall, but does not mention using a musical genre as the structuring principle for a novel.

Hence, B is the choice that would call the author's assertion into question.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune as a resolution to an incorrect prediction of Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The scientific episode we are looking for should involve making a prediction, finding a discrepancy, and resolving it after adjusting it based on new findings.

Choices analysis:
  A: Galileo's theory of tides shows a discrepancy in the prediction but doesn't mention a resolution based on new findings.
  B: Hubble settled a debate but does not involve changing predictions based on new findings or specific discrepancies.
  C: Alvarez postulated a cause for dinosaur extinction, and later, an impact crater was discovered in accordance with his hypothesis.
  D: Brunhes discovered rocks with opposite magnetization, concluded Earth's magnetic field reversed but doesn't involve adjusting a previous prediction.
  E: Pauli's postulated particle resolved a discrepancy, but it is not stated that this discovery led to an adjustment in a prediction. 

  The most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is C: Walter Alvarez postulating that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, as it involves making a prediction, finding a discrepancy, and resolving it by adjusting it based on new findings.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought process: 

- The discovery of Neptune, as described in passage B, involved predicting the existence of a planet based on the observed orbit of Uranus and Newton's laws.
- The discovery was confirmed when Neptune was found at the precise location required for the calculations to match the observations.

Now to look for an answer choice with a similar situation:

A: Galileo's theory of tides did not match observations and was not confirmed.
B: Hubble's discovery about Andromeda is unrelated to calculations matching observations.
C: Alvarez's postulation is more analogous, as he based his hypothesis on observed evidence and was later confirmed by the discovery of the impact crater.
D: Brunhes' discovery required only an observation, not matching calculations and observed data.
E: Pauli's postulation is interesting, but the discovery of the undetected particle isn't as crucial to the calculations as in the case of Neptune.

The best match to the discovery of Neptune is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune which happened because astronomers modified their auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  An analogous scientific episode should involve an incorrect prediction, a modification of assumptions or hypotheses, and the resulting discovery or confirmation.

  Choices analysis:
  A: Falsely predicted tides but doesn't mention a following discovery or confirmation due to any change in assumptions.
  B: Hubble discovering Andromeda seems more like a direct observation, rather than a change in assumptions leading to a discovery.
  C: Alvarez hypothesized about the asteroid impact and this hypothesis led to the discovery of evidence (impact crater) supporting the hypothesis.
  D: Brunhes discovery involved a direct observation about Earth's magnetic field, not a change in assumptions leading to a discovery.
  E: The postulation of a third undetected particle, later confirmed, seems similar but does not involve a change in auxiliary assumptions like in Passage B, it's about adding a new element to explain the contradiction.

  The best analogy is choice C: Alvarez hypothesized about the asteroid impact, changing assumptions, and discovered supporting evidence (impact crater).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  In passage B, the discovery of Neptune occurred because astronomers adjusted their auxiliary assumptions, predicting the presence of another planet, which was later confirmed.
  
  The scientific episode should be analogous to the discovery of Neptune, where an auxiliary assumption led to a hypothesis, which was later confirmed through observations.

  Choice C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Later evidence of a large impact crater confirmed his hypothesis.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In the discovery of Neptune described in passage B, the main steps were:
  1. A failed prediction: the predicted orbit of Uranus was incorrect.
  2. Changing auxiliary assumptions: astronomers considered the existence of another planet affecting Uranus' orbit.
  3. A final discovery in support of the changed assumptions: Neptune was found, validating the new assumptions.

Now we need to find the choice with a similar sequence of events.

Choices analysis:
  A: Galileo's theory made a false prediction, but there was no change in auxiliary assumptions and no discovery validating a new assumption.
  B: Hubble's discovery of Andromeda as a separate galaxy didn't involve a failed prediction or changed auxiliary assumptions.
  C: Alvarez's asteroid postulation was supported by the later discovery of an impact crater, which is similar to Neptune's discovery.
  D: Brunhes' conclusion about Earth's magnetic field reversal didn't involve a failed prediction or a change in auxiliary assumptions.
  E: While Pauli's postulation led to the discovery of a new particle, the problem was not based on a failed prediction.

Conclusion:
  Choice C is the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as both involved failed predictions, changing auxiliary assumptions, and a final discovery supporting the new assumptions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune after the predictions of Uranus's orbit were incorrect. Astronomers changed auxiliary assumptions and discovered Neptune in the correct location to align with their new calculations.
  
  We need to find an example where an incorrect prediction or observation led to a new discovery that helped to explain or fix the issue with the initial prediction or observation.

Choice Analysis:
  A: Galileo's theory of tides made a false prediction that did not lead to further discoveries.
  B: Hubble's discovery about Andromeda doesn't mention any incorrect predictions or observations that led to the discovery.
  C: Alvarez postulated the asteroid impact and later, an impact crater was discovered, making the prediction correct and supporting the initial hypothesis.
  D: Brunhes's discovery of reversed magnetic rocks led to a conclusion about Earth's magnetic field but doesn't mention incorrect predictions or observations.
  E: Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle after noticing an energy discrepancy, and the particle was later confirmed.

The choice that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune in Passage B is C. The discovery of the impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula supports Alvarez's initial hypothesis and fixes the issue with earlier observations.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  In the discovery of Neptune (Passage B), a prediction based on one theory (Newton's laws) and auxiliary assumptions was incorrect. Astronomers then modified their auxiliary assumptions, eventually leading to the discovery of Neptune.

  Comparing this to the choices, we need to find a situation where a wrong prediction resulted in a modification of assumptions and then to a correct discovery.

  Choice C: Walter Alvarez postulated an asteroid impact causing dinosaur extinction based on evidence. Later, the discovery of an impact crater supported his postulate. This choice shows a situation where a theory's prediction was supported by additional evidence.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  In passage B, the discovery of Neptune involved scientists making a prediction based on a theory and auxiliary assumptions, finding the predictions incorrect, and then adjusting the auxiliary assumptions to account for the discrepancy, which ultimately led to the discovery of Neptune.

Choice A: Incorrect predictions were made, but there was no adjustment of auxiliary assumptions or indeed any discovery.

Choice B: A discovery was made, but it is not clear whether the discovery was driven by incorrect predictions or adjustments of auxiliary assumptions.

Choice C: Prediction based on observed evidence, an auxiliary assumption was made, and later evidence confirmed the prior hypothesis's predictions. This choice is most analogous to the Neptune example.

Choice D: A discovery was made, and it is not clear whether the discovery was driven by the adjustment of auxiliary assumptions.

Choice E: An incorrect prediction was made, a missing particle was hypothesized, and later confirmed. However, it is not clear whether the auxiliary assumptions were adjusted specifically in this case.

Based on the comparison, choice C is most analogous to the Neptune example described in passage B.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune in passage B involved astronomers hypothesizing the existence of another planet based on the failed prediction of Uranus' orbit and later finding evidence to confirm their hypothesis.
  We need to find a similar scientific episode where a hypothesis is made based on an observation or failed prediction, and later evidence confirms the hypothesis.

  A: Involves false predictions but doesn't involve any supported hypothesis.
  B: Involves settling the debate about the universe based on observations but doesn't involve a failed prediction or hypothesis.
  C: Involves a hypothesis based on an observation and later finding supporting evidence. This is similar to Neptune episode.
  D: Involves the discovery of rocks and conclusion based on them but doesn't involve a failed prediction or hypothesis supported by evidence.
  E: Involves a hypothesis based on an observation (missing energy) and later confirmation of the particle. This is similar to Neptune episode, but the missing energy problem doesn't involve failed predictions as directly related to Uranus' orbit.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune in Passage B is characterized by:
  - Incorrect predictions based on a theory and auxiliary assumptions
  - A change in auxiliary assumptions (existence of another planet) to explain the observed phenomenon
  - Actual discovery of the new planet (Neptune) that confirmed the updated assumptions

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk and how this distinction is perceived by laypeople and policy experts. The author mentions that policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake and might not pay as much attention to whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary. It is stated that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention and are of little utility in guiding policy decisions. Let's analyze each statement.

A: The author doesn't explicitly mention that people should not be protected against voluntarily incurred risks in the passage.

B: This statement aligns with the passage, which explains that policy experts focus more on aggregate lives at stake than on the voluntary or involuntary nature of risks.

C: The passage does not provide information about the comparison of probabilities of plane crashes and other risks for airline passengers.

D: The author argues that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not very useful in guiding policy decisions, contradicting this statement.

E: The passage doesn't state that risks of natural disasters are the main category of risks incurred involuntarily. The only example mentioned of a completely involuntary risk is an unforeseeable asteroid collision.

Based on the analysis, statement B seems to be most in line with the ideas presented in the passage.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- The author believes that judgments about "voluntary" and "involuntary" risks are unclear and should not guide policy decisions.
- Public policy should instead be guided by saving as many lives as possible given limited resources, not the voluntary/involuntary nature of risks.

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

A: This statement is not addressed in the passage and does not align with the author's perspective on policy. Establishing a socially useful purpose is subjective.

B: This statement aligns with the author's belief that policy should be guided by saving as many lives as possible, regardless of voluntary or involuntary risk. Policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake rather than the voluntary/involuntary nature of risk.

C: The passage does not provide information about probability or comparisons involving plane crash risks.

D: This statement tries to define voluntarily incurred risks, but the author argues that voluntary/involuntary risk distinctions are not clear and should not guide public policy.

E: The passage only discusses the asteroid collision as a completely involuntary risk and does not suggest that natural disasters are the main category of such risks.

Based on the analysis, the author would likely agree with choice B, which emphasizes saving as many lives as possible rather than focusing on the voluntary/involuntary nature of risks.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the difference between voluntary and involuntary risk and its impact on public policy. The author mentions how most people believe that the government should intervene in cases of involuntary risk, but not voluntary risk. Policy experts, however, do not place as much importance on whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary, instead focusing on saving lives with available resources. They argue that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not clear-cut.

Let's analyze the answer choices:

  A: The passage does not focus on whether activities like skydiving are socially useful or not. The point was about people's perception of voluntary and involuntary risk.
  
  B: This statement aligns with the author's view that policy experts do not focus on whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary. Instead, they focus on saving lives with available resources.
  
  C: The passage does not discuss probabilities of plane crashes compared to other risks. 
  
  D: This statement seems to try to define voluntariness in the context of public-policy purposes, which is not the main point of the passage. The author argues that voluntariness should serve as proxies for other considerations, not as the sole determining factor.
  
  E: The passage only uses the risk of an asteroid collision as an example of a completely involuntary risk, not natural disasters as a whole.

The statement that best aligns with the author's view is B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and how these concepts impact policy decisions. The author discusses the complexities in determining when a risk is voluntarily incurred and argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." He proposes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.

  Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

  A: The passage does not specifically say that people should not be protected against risks like skydiving.
  
  B: The passage states that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, unlike laypeople who care about whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. So the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would be irrelevant to policy experts. This choice aligns with the author's point of view.

  C: The passage doesn't mention that plane crashes are the highest risk for airline passengers.

  D: The passage shows the difficulty of deeming a risk voluntary or involuntary and argues that these concepts should not be the basis for public-policy decisions.

  E: The passage does not specifically mention that the risk of natural disaster is the main category incurred completely involuntarily.

  The author would agree with choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and how they impact policy decisions. It emphasizes that judgments about these risks are often not helpful in determining policy. The passage suggests that regulatory policy should consider factors that underlie judgments about whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary, instead of focusing solely on the notion of voluntariness.

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: The passage doesn't suggest that people should not be protected against dangerous activities with no social purpose. It only offers that as an example of a voluntary risk.
  B: The passage states that policy experts typically focus on aggregate lives and not the voluntary nature of a risk. This aligns with the fact that plane crash victims choosing to fly is largely irrelevant to government decisions about air safety.
  C: The passage doesn't discuss the probability of occurrence or resulting injury for plane crashes compared to other risks airline passengers face.
  D: The passage doesn't provide a specific definition for when a risk should be considered voluntarily incurred for public-policy purposes.
  E: The passage only mentions asteroid collision as an example of a risk incurred completely involuntarily. It doesn't state that natural disasters are the main category of involuntarily incurred risks.

  Based on the passage, the author would most likely agree with statement B.

  Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks and states that regulatory policy should focus on better understanding the factors underlying judgments about voluntariness. The author suggests that notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary" do not have any special magic.

Choice A: The passage does not specifically discuss policies regarding the protection of individuals engaged in dangerous activities like skydiving.

Choice B: The passage indicates that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake, while laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. This statement aligns with that observation.

Choice C: The passage does not compare the probability of occurrence or resulting death or injury of airplane crashes to other kinds of risks.

Choice D: The passage dismisses the idea of purely voluntary and involuntary risks, stating that most risks fall somewhere in between.

Choice E: The passage mentions the risk of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid as an example of a completely involuntary risk, but it doesn't claim that the main category of involuntarily incurred risk is the risk of natural disasters.

Conclusion: The best choice that aligns with the author's stance is B, as it relates to the distinction between policy experts' and laypeople's judgments about risks.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

Thought:
  The passage discusses voluntary and involuntary risks along with the distinction of laypeople and policy experts. It also states that the underlying factors for judging voluntariness should be considered rather than just relying on voluntary and involuntary definitions. The examples of skydiving and airplane safety are mentioned, but neither is prioritized over the other.

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: This choice discusses that people should not be protected against skydiving because it serves no socially useful purpose. The author does not mention this in the passage.
  B: This choice matches the passage's statement that policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake and laypeople care more about voluntary or involuntary risk. Therefore, plane crash victims' choice to fly would be irrelevant to policy experts.
  C: The passage does not provide any comparative data on the probability of occurrence and resulting death or injury for plane crashes.
  D: The author emphasizes that notions of voluntariness are not sufficient to guide policy decisions and that underlying factors need to be understood.
  E: The passage does not state that the risk of natural disasters is the main category that is usually incurred completely involuntarily.

  The answer seems to be B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake, while laypeople care about voluntary risks. The author suggests that regulatory policy should be based on saving as many lives as possible, using specific considerations rather than the voluntary nature of the risk.
  
  Given this understanding, the statement that aligns most closely with the author's view is B, which highlights policy experts' focus and the irrelevance of passengers' choices when it comes to decisions about government's role in air safety regulation.

Action:
Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author mentions that laypeople care whether a risk is taken voluntarily, while policy experts focus on aggregate lives at stake. This difference is emphasized to highlight that people's judgments about voluntariness are not necessarily helpful for guiding policy decisions.

  The author would most likely agree with the statement that policy experts would deem the choice to fly as largely irrelevant when deciding the government's role in regulating air safety. This reasoning is supported by the fact that experts focus on lives at stake rather than the voluntariness of the risk. Choice B conveys this idea.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the laypeople's focus on voluntary and involuntary risks and policy experts' focus on aggregate lives at stake.
  The author believes that judgments on voluntariness often stem from confusion and selective attention and should not guide policy decisions.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors underlying judgments about voluntariness.

Let's analyze each option:

A: The passage does not specifically address whether people should be protected against certain risks or not.
B: This statement aligns with the passage's argument that policy experts focus on the aggregate lives at stake, rather than whether the risk was voluntary or involuntary.
C: The passage doesn't discuss the probability of occurrence or resulting death or injury for plane crashes versus other risks.
D: The author discourages relying on voluntariness as a guide for public policy, so this statement doesn't align with the author's position.
E: The passage only provides the example of an asteroid collision as a completely involuntary risk, not natural disasters in general.

From the analysis, the option B aligns most closely with the author's perspective.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 16 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: Researchers see no incompatibility between unfettered basic research and the granting of biotechnology patents.
  D: Researchers increasingly believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: Most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by the ozone layer, protecting against skin cancer. It explains how CFCs deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. The Montreal Protocol and the banning of CFCs in North America led to the development of environmentally friendly alternatives, ultimately protecting the ozone layer.

  These facts support the idea that regulating CFCs indirectly contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer by preserving the effectiveness of the ozone layer.

  Therefore, the answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage states that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The ozone layer protects by filtering out damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Regulating the use of CFCs would, therefore, contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The passage discusses the harmful effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
- The ozone layer protects the earth from the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer.
- Molina and Rowland found that CFCs deplete the ozone layer and advocated for a public policy response.
- The Montreal Protocol of 1987 banned the production of ozone-depleting gases like CFCs.

From this information, we can conclude that regulating the use of CFCs would help protect the ozone layer, which in turn would protect against harmful ultraviolet radiation and contribute to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Molina and Rowland's research showed that CFCs lead to depletion of the ozone layer, which acts as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage states that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  The passage also describes how their advocacy inspired policy changes, such as the Montreal Protocol and the ban of CFCs in North America.
  Thus, regulating the use of CFCs would have the indirect effect of protecting the ozone layer and reducing the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the ozone layer screens out much of the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation and that depletion of this layer due to CFCs makes it less effective in this role. Since skin cancer is connected to ultraviolet light from the sun, it can be inferred that regulating the use of CFCs, and thereby protecting the ozone layer, indirectly contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that the ozone layer protects against the sun's damaging ultraviolet radiation, which contributes to skin cancer. It also explains how CFCs deplete the ozone layer, allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth's surface. By regulating the use of CFCs, the ozone layer can recover, reducing the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains the relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer (due to CFCs) and the effectiveness of the ozone layer as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. By regulating the use of CFCs, we can help protect the ozone layer, which in turn, can contribute to reducing the risk of skin cancer.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  - Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - Ozone layer in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  - Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  - Depletion of ozone layer continues even if CFCs production stops.
  - The passage states that by regulating the use of CFCs, the depletion of the ozone layer would be controlled, thus indirectly leading to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer and the ozone layer in the stratosphere screens out much of this harmful radiation. It also explains that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. The passage mentions that as a result of the advocacy of Molina and Rowland, CFCs were banned, which led to the development of more environmentally friendly alternatives. These points indicate that regulating the use of CFCs helps to maintain the ozone layer's protection against ultraviolet radiation, thereby indirectly lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

  The answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the sun's ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer but is screened out by the ozone layer. Molina and Rowland's research shows that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, reducing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. As the production and use of CFCs are regulated and decreased, the ozone layer's depletion can be slowed, indirectly leading to lowering the incidence of skin cancer caused by excessive ultraviolet radiation.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The primary function of the third paragraph is to

Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Thought process:
  Lines 7-11 discuss the opinions of some legal scholars saying that the lawyers' job is to provide the best defense possible without judging the innocence of their clients.
  Lines 28-31 talk about how a "best defense" is provided by an advocate who, after an analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case.
  These sentences seem to be in general agreement over the obligation of a lawyer to provide the best defense. However, they suggest a disagreement over the need for lawyers to be convinced of the merits of the case to provide the best defense.
  Therefore, the relationship between these sentences can most accurately be described as agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The sentence in lines 7-11 states: "According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves."

Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case."
  The relationship between these statements can be described as agreement in general (both advocate for lawyers acting in the best interest of their clients) but disagreement over particulars (one says lawyers should say only what defendants would say while the other argues that lawyers should be advocates based on case facts, not necessarily taking every case).
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states: "Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case."
  The sentence at lines 7-11 states: "They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel."

  Comparing these two sentences:
  - Both advocate for lawyers to focus on the facts of the case.
  - They're not essentially equivalent assertions, so not E.
  - They're not unrelated, so not A.
  - The latter sentence is not opposing the former sentence, so not B.
  - It isn't describing a hypothetical situation, so not C.
  
  Therefore, the relationship of the information can be described as:
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- Lines 7-11 discuss the belief that lawyers should not express or act on personal opinions, and should only represent their clients as advocates.
- Lines 28-31 emphasize that lawyers should appraise the case in their client's favor while considering the facts, and present extenuating circumstances for leniency in sentencing if they know the client is guilty.
- The relationship between the two sentences is a disagreement over the particulars. While both discuss the role of lawyers, the second part argues that lawyers should not deny guilt when they know with certainty that a defendant is guilty.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Lines 7-11 discuss the opinion of some legal scholars regarding the role of lawyers in defending their clients and that they should provide the best defense possible without expressing their personal opinions.
  Lines 28-31 suggest that, even though entitled to defense, lawyers should not take every case offered and should advocate for the defendant based on the facts of the case rather than being mere mouthpieces.
  
  The relationship between these two sections shows a general agreement with the earlier position (that every client is entitled to a defense) but disagreement over the particulars (lawyers should be selective in the cases they take and not just be mouthpieces).

  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
Lines 28-31: Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Lines 7-11: They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel.
  
Relation between lines 28-31 and lines 7-11 is that the author agrees with the general idea that lawyers should represent the rights and interests of the defendant, but disagrees or expands on the specifics. So, the correct answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Lines 7-11 describe legal scholars' opinion that lawyers have no right to judge defendants and must provide the best possible legal representation.
  Lines 28-31 explain that a "best defense" can be provided by an advocate who has carefully analyzed the facts and is convinced of the merits of the case, also claiming the lawyer's obligation to the court and society in general ultimately benefits the defendant.

There is a connection between the two sentences. The lines 28-31 do not completely disagree with the opinion in lines 7-11 but emphasize the importance of an advocate's conviction in the merits of the case.

Answer:
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Lines 28-31: "The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case."
  Lines 7-11: They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.

In lines 28-31, the author mentions that lawyers should be advocates for the rights of the defendant considering the facts of the case despite every client being entitled to a defense. In lines 7-11, the author explains the opinion that lawyers shouldn't judge defendants because it's the court's job to determine guilt and the lawyer's job to represent the defendant. 

These statements reflect agreement over the general principle that all clients have the right to a proper defense, but disagreement over the particulars of each case and the role of the defense lawyer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Lines 7-11: "They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel."
  Lines 28-31: "The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case."

  The relationship between these two statements is that, while they generally agree on the role of defense lawyers, they differ in their approach on how lawyers should handle cases where they believe their clients are guilty. The earlier statement is focused primarily on the lawyer's role in constructing the best possible defense and does not explicitly address the lawyer's duty to the court, whereas the later statement emphasizes the importance of the lawyer's obligation to the court and society.

  Thus, the relationship can most accurately be described as:
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
Lines 7-11: The lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves.

Lines 28-31: The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

Comparison: Both statements are about the role and obligations of defense lawyers. The first statement emphasizes that lawyers should act as advocates for their clients, while the second statement asserts that lawyers should not take every case and should be advocates for the rights of the defendant based on the facts. There is some disagreement between these statements, particularly regarding the selectivity of defense lawyers in accepting cases.

The relationship can be most accurately described as:
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12–13) most probably in order to

Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the scientific assumptions about alcoholic beverages and their effects on health. It explains how scientists have considered wine, beer, and distilled spirits as similar, without looking into the unique healthful effects of wine. The passage presents evidence about the positive physiological effects of moderate wine consumption and the potential reasons behind them. The primary concern of the author seems to be correcting the scientific misconception that all alcoholic beverages have the same physiological effects.

Action: Answer("C")

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought:
- FMRI scans of brain activity are described as depicting the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain.
- The interpretation involves subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the brain activity associated with the cognitive task.
- This subtractive method obscures the distributed brain functions, creating a false impression of neat functional localization.

Choice analysis:
  A: This choice focuses on the importance of one district's vote, which is not related to the concept of differential interpretation and subtraction.
  B: This choice involves isolating the effect of an advertising campaign during a certain period, which is analogous to subtracting baseline activity to identify a particular influence.
  C: This choice does not involve subtraction or the obscuring of other factors, as it just highlights the difference in water usage between two sectors.
  D: This choice does not involve subtraction or differential interpretations and focuses on the difference between home and office internet usage during peak hours.
  E: This choice does not involve subtraction, instead providing a conditional statement about the cheetah's speed over various distances.

The most analogous choice to the FMRI interpretation described in the text is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The FMRI scans are interpreted by taking a baseline measurement, and then subtracting it from the on-task measurement, creating a possibly false impression of functional localization. The question asks for an analogy to this method of interpretation. 

A: This choice highlights dependency on one district for the mayor's win, unlike the FMRI interpretation method.
B: This choice focuses on the effect of the ad campaign for a period, which might be analogous to the idea of subtracting the effect of the baseline condition, leaving what appears to be the effect of the cognitive task.
C: This choice emphasizes the impact on one sector, but it's not related to a subtractive method of interpretation.
D: This choice describes the difference in traffic between hours and locations, but isn't really about subtracting one condition from another.
E: This statement is about the cheetah's speed limitation, but it doesn't involve subtracting any factors or conditions.

Choice B is the most similar to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The key point in the passage is that FMRI scans show the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting baseline measurement from the on-task measurement. The remaining difference represents the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task, creating a false impression of neat functional localization. The question asks for an analogy to this manner of interpreting FMRI scans.
  
  Analyzing the choices:
  A: Refers to a district's impact on voting, not a subtraction method or false impression of localization.
  B: Mentions an advertising campaign and increased summer shoppers, implying the campaign's impact on a particular season, which is an analogy to false localization.
  C: Focuses on drought impact on different sectors, not on localization or subtraction method.
  D: Compares peak hour traffic to the origin of traffic, not related to the subtraction method or false impressions of localization.
  E: Refers to the cheetah's running ability, not relevant to FMRI scans, subtraction methods, or false localization.

  The best analogy to the FMRI interpretation method described is Choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  FMRI scans are described as showing differential rate of oxygen use, which is obtained by subtracting baseline activity from on-task activity. This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, giving a false impression of functional localization. So, we need to find an answer choice that involves a similar situation where some information is removed or downplayed, giving a false impression.

  Choice A: This does not have a subtraction or obscuring aspect.
  Choice B: This involves an incorrect conclusion without subtracting or obscuring some data.
  Choice C: Talks about water usage without any subtraction or obscuring.
  Choice D: This demonstrates interpreting information without considering other factors that might be involved alongside the primary observation, similar to the FMRI example.
  Choice E: This makes an incorrect assumption, but it does not involve a subtractive or obscuring aspect.

  As a result, the most analogous answer is D, where internet traffic is primarily considered during peak hour, obscuring the traffic during non-peak hours.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

Thought: 
The primary similarity between the FMRI interpretation and the analogy we are looking for is that both create false impressions based on subtractive comparisons.

A: This choice does not use a subtractive comparison or create a false impression.
B: It's an example of using subtraction as the method to attribute results to an advertising campaign, and it doesn't show the whole picture.
C: This choice focuses on impact severity, not subtraction comparison.
D: This choice focuses on peak hours and location, not subtraction comparison.
E: This choice highlights limits in cheetah abilities, not subtraction comparison.

Based on the analysis, the option "B" is the most analogous to the manner described in FMRI scans.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought process:
- fMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
- The question is looking for an analogous situation.

Choices analysis:
A: This choice talks about a particular district that contributed to the mayor's win, but it does not involve subtraction.
B: This choice involves the conclusion that advertisements affected only summer shoppers, which seems related to the subtractive process.
C: This choice is about comparison and impact of water supply use but does not involve subtraction.
D: This choice talks about peak hours for internet traffic, but no subtraction is mentioned.
E: This choice is about the cheetah's speed limitation over long distances but does not incorporatesubtraction.

Based on the above analysis, choice B seems to be the most analogous to the fMRI interpretation process as it involves drawing conclusions based on differences over time.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
- FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted by taking the difference between the activity during a cognitive task and the baseline activity.
- The method gives a false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions.

I need to find an answer choice that is most analogous to this situation.

A: This choice talks about the large margin of votes for the new mayor in a specific district, but it doesn't focus on subtraction or localization of an effect, like the FMRI scans.

B: This choice talks about an advertising campaign, connecting the summer increase in shoppers specifically to the campaign due to the timing. It focuses on the effects of the campaign and isolates the effect on summer shoppers. This seems analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.

C: This choice discusses the impact of drought on agriculture compared to residential water supply. It doesn't focus on subtraction or localization of a specific factor, so it isn't very analogous to the FMRI scans.

D: This choice focuses on Internet traffic being higher in the evening and assumes more traffic comes from homes rather than office buildings during peak hours. While it does make an assumption, it isn't as analogous to the subtraction and localization aspects of the FMRI scans.

E: This choice compares the cheetah's speed for short and long distances. It doesn't involve subtraction, localization, or making false assumptions like the FMRI scans.

The choice that is most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans is (B), linking the summer increase in shoppers specifically to the yearlong advertising campaign.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement, creating a false impression of neat functional localization and obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. This means we are looking for an answer choice that involves a situation where an inaccurate conclusion is drawn based on the difference between two conditions or measurements.

Choice analysis:
  A: This choice implies causation due to one district's support, but it doesn't involve subtraction and false localization like the FMRI example.
  B: This option involves subtraction (advertising impact) and may create a false impression of when the ads were effective, which is similar to the FMRI example.
  C: The impact of droughts on the agricultural sector may be true, but it doesn't involve subtraction and false localization like the FMRI example.
  D: This choice relates to peak times and types of Internet users, but it does not deal with subtraction and misleading conclusions.
  E: This option involves the limitation of cheetahs running at high speeds. Still, it doesn't show any subtraction or false localization as in the FMRI example.

The answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  FMRI scans of brain activity interpretation involve subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement to isolate the activity associated with the cognitive task.
  The correct choice must be analogous to this process where a subtraction or comparison of two situations is made to identify the influence of a certain factor.

Choice Analyses:
  A: This doesn't involve subtraction or comparison between two situations, just an emphasis on one district's impact.
  B: This involves comparing the effect of advertising on summer shoppers by considering the yearlong advertising campaign impact. This is analogous to the FMRI interpretation process.
  C: This choice doesn't involve a subtractive process or comparison between two situations, just the different proportions of water consumption.
  D: This choice is about the origin of traffic, not a subtraction or comparison between two situations.
  E: This choice focuses on a limitation, not a subtractive process or comparison between two situations.

The answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
- FMRI scans involve subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement, creating a false impression of functional localization.
- We need to find the choice that is most analogous to this process and its interpretation.

Analysis:
A: This choice doesn't involve a comparison or subtraction-based interpretation.
B: The store's ads affect summer shoppers, but this isn't really analogous to subtracting background activity to get a picture of a specific event.
C: This choice involves a comparison between two types of consumers, but not a subtraction-based interpretation.
D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening, but again, this doesn't involve subtracting something to get a clearer picture.
E: Cheetahs being fast only for short distances is not analogous to a subtraction-based interpretation.

None of the choices are a great analogy, but choice B is the closest as it involves attributing a specific effect (increase in shoppers during the summer) to a cause (the advertising campaign). The choice describes an oversimplified interpretation of the data, similar to how FMRI scans oversimplify brain activity.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph suggests that understanding non-Western cultures by the methods of Western science is distortion and expression of cultural chauvinism. The critics argue that adopting the perspectives and methods of the studied culture is necessary for real understanding.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The second paragraph talks about critics' arguments against the second version of multicultural education. Critics say that the Western scientific approach is value-laden and not neutral as it claims to be. They argue that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied, which are often nonscientific.

  Now let's analyze the answer choices:

  A: The passage does not mention that the critics believe it is impossible for members of a culture with different values to understand the social and historical circumstances of another culture. This choice is too strong.
  B: The passage mentions that critics argue that value systems "have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances" - so this choice aligns with the critics' view that these factors play a role in shaping a culture's values.
  C: The passage does not mention the necessity of multiple cultural perspectives for studying another culture.
  D: The passage does not state that genuine understanding requires sharing the same cultural values.
  E: The passage is not focused on understanding the values of liberalism through Western science methods.

  The answer choice that best matches the critics' view in the second paragraph is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The main idea in the second paragraph is that critics object to the second form of multicultural education because they believe studying other cultures using Western scientific methods is biased and distorting, whereas real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the native perspectives of the cultures being studied.
  Choice A suggests that it is impossible to understand the circumstances of a culture with different values, which is not the stance of the critics.
  Choice B is a correct statement, but it doesn't capture the main point of the second paragraph.
  Choice C argues for studying from multiple perspectives, but it doesn't mention adopting the perspectives of the cultures being studied.
  Choice D is an extreme claim that doesn't represent what the critics in the second paragraph argue for.
  Choice E focuses on liberalism and is not related to the objection the critics have raised in the second paragraph.
  The best answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Critics in the second paragraph argue that understanding other cultures from a neutral or scientific standpoint is not sufficient because methods used in Western culture are value-laden themselves and might not be suitable to understand non-Western cultures. They believe that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied is essential for genuine understanding.
  
  Let's analyze the choices:
  A: The argument is not about the inability to understand a culture's values due to different values, but the methodology used in understanding the culture.
  B: This choice reflects the critics' belief that historical and social circumstances play a significant role in shaping a culture's values, making it a potential answer.
  C: Critics argue that genuine understanding requires adopting the perspective of the culture being studied, but they don't explicitly assert the need for multiple cultural perspectives.
  D: The critics' argument is not about sharing the same cultural values for genuine understanding but about using the appropriate methodology for understanding various cultures.
  E: This choice talks about the values of liberalism and their understanding, not the general argument made by critics about understanding other cultures.

  Based on the analysis, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:

The critics argue that using Western scientific methods to study other cultures is biased and leads to misunderstanding those cultures. They believe that understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied. 

We should identify which answer aligns with the critics' argument that understanding a culture requires studying it from within that culture's perspective.

A: This is not what critics argue. They argue that understanding is limited if examined through a different culture's perspective, not that it's impossible.
B: This agrees with the critics' argument, but it is not the main point they are making. The main point is about the perspectives and methods used for understanding other cultures.
C: This option aligns well with the critics' argument that genuine understanding requires studying the culture from its own perspective.
D: The critics are not arguing that shared cultural values are necessary for understanding; they argue that adopting a culture's perspective and methods is necessary.
E: The passage is not about the values of liberalism being understood through the methods of Western science.

Answer: Choice C best reflects the critics' argument that true understanding of other cultures requires studying from more than one cultural perspective.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The critics described in the second paragraph argue that examining non-Western cultures through the lens of Western scientific methods is distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. They contend that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.

So, considering the choices:
  A: The passage does not imply that understanding is impossible for members of a culture with different values, but rather insists on adopting the studied culture's perspectives and methods.
  B: Critics mentioned that value systems arise in different social and historical circumstances, so this aligns with their views.
  C: The passage states that critics believe understanding can be achieved only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, but it does not mention requiring more than one cultural perspective.
  D: The critics argue that the method of study matters, not whether the cultures share the same cultural values.
  E: The passage does not specifically address the values of liberalism in relation to the methods of Western science.

  The best answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph states that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
  Critics argue that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Therefore, the choice that best aligns with the critics' view is that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph states that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. This means that understanding is impossible when examining other cultures solely from the scientific or methodological perspective of the majority culture. The critics emphasize that the Western scientific heritage could distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.

  Based on this information, we can eliminate:
  - Option A, as it implies that understanding is impossible even when recognizing and considering the different circumstances that give rise to a culture's values.
  - Option C, as it implies that studying another culture requires multiple perspectives of the same culture. In contrast, critics emphasize the importance of understanding other cultures from their own standpoint.
  - Option D, as it means that understanding is only possible when the cultures share the same values, which does not align with the main criticism in the text.
  - Option E, as it emphasizes liberalism and Western science, which is not directly related to the objection presented in the paragraph.

  The correct answer is:
  - Option B, as it aligns with the critics' arguments that the historical and social circumstances of a culture play an essential role in understanding the development of that culture's values. Thus, understanding requires approaching the culture from its perspectives and methods.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The critics mentioned in the second paragraph argue that understanding other cultures through the lens of Western scientific methods is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. They believe that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. 

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: The critics don't claim that understanding is impossible, just that it requires adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture studied.
  B: This aligns with the critics' argument, as they mention that value systems arise from different social and historical circumstances.
  C: The critics emphasize adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture studied, not necessarily multiple cultural perspectives.
  D: The critics don't argue that shared cultural values are required but rather understanding the culture from its own perspectives and methods.
  E: This choice talks about understanding liberalism, which is not the main focus of the critics' argument.

  The answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
Critics discussed in the second paragraph mainly focus on the fact that trying to understand non-Western cultures from the perspective of Western scientific methodologies is distorting and expresses an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

Choice A is not consistent with the critics' argument since they believe that understanding of other cultures is possible, but not through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.

Choice B is consistent with the critics' argument as they recognize that different cultures arise from different historical and social circumstances.

Choice C is more about multiple cultural perspectives, which is not the main point of the critics discussed in the second paragraph.

Choice D claims that only cultures with the same values can understand each other, which is not the main argument of the critics. They believe in understanding other cultures without using the majority culture's perspective.

Choice E is not the main point of the critics since they're more focused on not using Western scientific methodologies to understand other cultures, not on understanding liberalism.

Based on the critics' main argument, the best choice is B.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage explains the interaction between plants and insects through the development and roles of secondary substances in plants. It discusses how secondary substances play a role in attracting pollinators, deterring potential plant-eating insects, and contributing to the ongoing evolutionary competition between plants and insects. The main point should encapsulate the significance of secondary substances in plants and the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects.

Consider the choices:
A: This choice focuses only on the defensive role of secondary substances, not their full significance.
B: This choice focuses on narrowing the range of secondary substances and insect species, but not the effect of the interaction.
C: This choice reflects the overall impact of secondary substances on the distinctive tastes and smells of plants and how these distinctions have resulted from the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects.
D: This choice focuses only on secondary substances being similar among related species, not their significance in the interaction between plants and insects.
E: This choice acknowledges the competitive interaction between plants and insects due to plant mutations and secondary substances, but does not address the resulting characteristics of plants.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about the implications of neuroscience on the law and suggests changes to the criminal justice system, abandoning retribution, and focusing on deterrence.
  Passage B presents the theory of "soft determinism" by Alfred J. Ayer and discusses the difference between free actions and constrained actions, arguing that free actions can exist in a deterministic world.

  A - engaged: Both passages are engaged in discussing their ideas.
  B - dismissive: Passage B is not dismissive of its ideas, as it presents a well-argued theory.
  C - detached: Passage B offers a thorough explanation of "soft determinism" and the distinction between free and constrained actions.
  D - ironic: Passage B is not ironic, as it presents the theory sincerely and without irony.
  E - skeptical: Passage A is more skeptical of the free will concept, while Passage B is presenting an alternative view that reconciles free will with determinism.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience findings challenge the idea of free will and suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterrence rather than retribution.
  Passage B presents a viewpoint that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely, and it introduces the concept of "soft determinism" by Ayer. It distinguishes between free and constrained actions.

  Now, let's analyze the attitude related to each choice.
  A: Engaged: Interested and involved.
  B: Dismissive: Showing that something is unworthy of attention.
  C: Detached: Unbiased and emotionally disconnected.
  D: Ironic: Using words to convey an opposite meaning of what's expected.
  E: Skeptical: Having doubts or questioning the ideas presented.

  Both passages engage with the ideas they present without showing skepticism or irony. Passage B does not dismiss the idea of determinism but extends it by introducing Ayer's "soft determinism."

  Therefore, the attitude in Passage B is more engaged than the attitude in Passage A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience findings change the way we think about law and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterrence.
  Passage B introduces the concept of "soft determinism" proposed by Ayer, which states that free will can coexist with determinism and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
  Passage B discusses Ayer's ideas in a more detached manner, presenting a philosophical viewpoint in contrast to the applied implications presented in passage A.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses how neuroscience findings can affect the way we think about law and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution in favor of deterrence. 
  Passage B presents Alfred J. Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" and argues that free will can coexist with determinism. Ayer distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, with free actions still capable of existing in a deterministic world.

  Comparing the attitudes toward the ideas discussed in each passage:
  - Passage A seems to call for a change in the legal system based on neuroscience findings, suggesting a more engaged perspective.
  - Passage B is presenting a philosophical argument and explaining how free will can coexist with determinism, which shows a more detached and analytical perspective.

  Therefore, Passage B displays a more detached attitude toward the ideas it discusses compared to Passage A.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that recent findings in neuroscience force us to rethink our legal ideas about punishment and the concept of free choice, shifting the focus from retribution to deterrence. The tone of passage A appears to be engaged.
  Passage B discusses the idea of soft determinism and how it allows for the concept of free will to coexist with determinism, even in a deterministic world. This passage adopts a more detached tone as it's not advocating for a change in views or practices but simply presenting a theory that has already been established by philosophers. 

  Therefore, the attitude of Passage B from Passage A is more detached.

  A: engaged - Both passages are engaged with their respective topics.
  B: dismissive - Passage B is not dismissive of the ideas it discusses.
  C: detached - Passage B explains Ayer's theory without being overly critical or supportive of Passage A's ideas; this is the closest term to describe the attitude.
  D: ironic - There is no irony in Passage B's approach.
  E: skeptical - Passage B is not skeptical of the ideas discussed, but rather presents an alternative viewpoint.

  Answer: C: detached
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience question the idea of free will and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B presents a counterargument, discussing the concept of "soft determinism" by Alfred J. Ayer, which states that free will can coexist with determinism, and that actions can still be considered free as long as they are not constrained by external factors.

  A: engaged - Both passages engage with the topic, so this doesn't differentiate Passage B from Passage A.
  B: dismissive - Passage B does not dismiss the ideas presented in Passage A but rather offers a counterargument.
  C: detached - Both passages present arguments rooted in philosophical and scientific concepts, but Passage B does not display a detached attitude.
  D: ironic - Passage B exhibits no irony in its presentation of Ayer's ideas.
  E: skeptical - Passage B exhibits skepticism towards the conclusion in Passage A by providing a counterargument.

Answer: The attitude differential between the two passages is best described by "skeptical."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the idea that the law should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B introduces the concept of "soft determinism" and argues that actions can still be considered free if they are caused by internal sources (one's own will) rather than external sources.

  A: engaged - both passages discuss their respective ideas thoroughly
  B: dismissive - both passages address the topic without dismissing the opposing view
  C: detached - Passage B explains an alternative philosophical perspective on free will and determinism, which is different from passage A's focus on the implications for the law
  D: ironic - neither passage uses irony
  E: skeptical - Passage A appears more skeptical of the current legal system and the idea of free will, while Passage B offers a middle ground through the concept of "soft determinism"

  The answer is C: detached, as Passage B is objectively presenting the philosophical concept of "soft determinism" without discussing the implications for the law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A presents a viewpoint that neuroscience challenges the perception of free will in the legal context and suggests abandoning the idea of retribution in the criminal justice system.
  Passage B discusses the coexistence of free will and determinism, presenting the concept of "soft determinism" by Ayer. It focuses on the origin of actions, whether they are free or constrained, and how this relates to the idea of free will.

  Comparison of Attitudes:
  A: engaged - Both passages engage with their respective subjects.
  B: dismissive - Passage B is not dismissing the ideas it discusses; instead, it presents a different perspective on free will and determinism.
  C: detached - Passage B explains the concept of soft determinism without showing a clear detachment from the ideas.
  D: ironic - There is no irony present in Passage B's discussion.
  E: skeptical - Passage B offers a different perspective but is not necessarily skeptical of the ideas.

  Out of the given choices, "detached" seems to be the best fit for describing the difference in attitude between the two passages.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience have changed the way we think about the law, as it questions the concept of free choice, suggesting that the criminal justice system should abandon the idea of retribution.
  Passage B, on the other hand, refers to the concept of "soft determinism," as it presents a philosophical viewpoint that free will can coexist with determinism even in a world where causes are known. The passage takes a more engaged approach to the idea of free will and determinism.

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: Engaged - To be actively involved or interested in the subject matter.
  B: Dismissive - To treat something as unworthy of consideration or attention.
  C: Detached - To be impartial, distant, or disconnected from the subject matter.
  D: Ironic - To express one's meaning using language that signifies the opposite, usually for humorous or emphatic effect.
  E: Skeptical - To have doubts or reservations about the subject matter.

  Based on the comparison, Passage B is more engaged with the ideas it discusses.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn
Response 0:
Thought:
  In the passage, Matthew Arnold characterizes the aristocracy as "Barbarians" with interests mainly in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as "Philistines" who are obsessed with respectability.
  These descriptions imply a negative view of both social classes and do not show respect, empathy, or indifference.
  The most suitable terms might be disappointment or scorn since he seems to be critical of their values and interests.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  In the passage, it is mentioned that Matthew Arnold characterized the aristocracy as Barbarians and the middle class as Philistines. The aristocracy is described as being interested mainly in fox hunting and gaming, while the middle class is depicted as being obsessed with respectability. This characterization is not positive and does not show respect or empathy; it also does not appear indifferent. The tone suggests a negative view of both classes, suggesting either disappointment or scorn.

  The answer is likely either D: disappointment or E: scorn. Since "disappointment" implies an expectation of better behavior from the aristocratic and middle classes and "scorn" suggests active contempt, the characterization that Arnold labeled both classes with negative terms makes E: scorn the most fitting answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  In the passage, Matthew Arnold characterizes the aristocracy as Barbarians, who are mostly interested in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. This description does not show respect, empathy, or indifference, but rather a negative view of these two social classes.

  Among the remaining options, disappointment and scorn are the two possible choices. Since Arnold characterizes them as Barbarians and Philistines, which are derogatory terms, it is more appropriate to say that his attitude reflects scorn.

  Therefore, the answer is E: scorn.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Matthew Arnold described the aristocracy as "Barbarians" and the middle class as "Philistines."
  These descriptions suggest a negative or dismissive attitude towards these social classes.
  Given the available choices, the closest term that reflects this attitude is "scorn."

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Matthew Arnold characterized the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability.
  This characterization implies that Arnold had a negative view of these social classes.
  As for the choices, respect and empathy are both positive, so we can eliminate them. Indifference would mean not having a strong opinion. The remaining options are disappointment or scorn.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Matthew Arnold described aristocracy as "Barbarians" who were interested in fox hunting and gaming.
  He described the middle class as "Philistines" who were obsessed with respectability.
  This characterization suggests a negative attitude rather than respect, empathy, or indifference.
  Between disappointment and scorn, disappointment implies an expectation that was not met, whereas scorn implies contempt or disdain.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  In the passage, Arnold characterized the aristocracy as "Barbarians" focused on hunting and gaming and the middle class as "Philistines" focused on respectability. Given these characterizations, it does not seem that he viewed these classes with respect, empathy, or indifference. 
  Arnold's characterization seems more negative, which could indicate disappointment or scorn.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Matthew Arnold characterized the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability.
  These characterizations by Arnold are not positive or respectful.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Arnold's attitude toward the aristocratic and middle classes was not positive or respectful.
  Out of the options given, scorn would be the closest choice to a negative view. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions Matthew Arnold's characterization of the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. This description implies a negative view of both classes, as they are depicted as being focused on superficial activities and not supporting meaningful art. Therefore, his attitude can be best described as one of disappointment or scorn. Between these two options, scorn implies a stronger negative feeling.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes Matthew Arnold's characterization of the aristocracy as "Barbarians" and the middle class as "Philistines."
  This representation of both classes shows a negative view and dissatisfaction.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: disappointment.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The criticism in the passage of the second version of the multicultural education states that it is not essentially different from the first version, and that its methods rooted in Western science are value-laden and Eurocentric. The objection to that criticism should undermine this argument. 

  A: This strengthens the criticism since it suggests that understanding is truly impossible if not a member of the culture.
  B: Similar value systems don't address the criticism and don't really object to it.
  C: This offers an alternative perspective of how non-Western societies examine cultures, thus showing Western science's methods are not the only way to study other cultures.
  D: This statement focuses on understanding Western culture, not necessarily offering an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  E: While true, does not address the core criticism about the methods used in the second version of multicultural education.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still uses Western scientific methods which are value-laden, distorting and propagates Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. To find the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find a statement that undermines the reasoning behind the criticism or provides an alternative perspective.

  A: Addresses the difficulty of adopting the perspectives of other cultures, but it doesn't directly counter the criticism.
  B: The similarity of non-Western societies' value systems to each other doesn't address the criticism regarding the use of Western scientific methods.
  C: This statement points out that non-Western societies also use their value systems to study other cultures. This indicates that there might be some value in using one's own framework to study another, and potentially weakens the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  D: Doesn't address the criticism about studying non-Western cultures with Western scientific methods.
  E: Affirms the importance of genuine understanding but doesn't address the criticism of using Western scientific methods.

  Therefore, choice C provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education since it points out that non-Western societies also use their value systems to study other cultures.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still uses methods that derive from Western scientific perspectives, and that these methods are value laden and distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.
  
  To find the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to identify a statement that, if true, would weaken this argument and show that the methods used in the second version of multicultural education don't necessarily distort understanding of non-Western cultures.
  
  A: This statement suggests that adopting the perspectives and methods of other cultures is impossible, which could argue against any multicultural education method, thus it does not specifically counter the criticism of the second version.
  
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the criticism since the focus is not on similarities between non-Western cultures, but on the methods used to study them.
  
  C: This statement suggests that some non-Western societies judge other cultures by their own values, which weakens the criticism that using Western scientific methods is uniquely problematic for understanding non-Western cultures. If non-Western cultures do the same, then it's not necessarily an issue with only Western methods.
  
  D: This statement does not address the criticism about the use of Western scientific methods on non-Western cultures and is irrelevant.

  E: This statement supports the ultimate goal of multicultural education but does not specifically address the tools and methods used in the second version of multicultural education.

  Out of the given choices, choice C seems to provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education states that by using Western scientific methods to study other cultures, it distorts the understanding of those cultures and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
  To find an answer that would provide the strongest objection to this criticism, I need to look for an option that shows that using these methods does not necessarily result in distortion or maintains cultural chauvinism.
  
  A: This option states that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of another culture unless one is a member of that culture. This would support the criticism instead of providing an objection to it.
  B: This option is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, as the criticism revolves around the use of Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures.
  C: This option shows that non-Western societies also use their own value systems to study different cultures, implying that Western systems aren't the only cause for distortion. This might provide some objection to the criticism.
  D: This option is irrelevant to the criticism, as the criticism is about studying other cultures, not their own culture.
  E: This option is true but does not provide a direct objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, as it does not address whether Western scientific methods can lead to genuine understanding.

  Out of all the options, C provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still relies on Western scientific methods, which are already value-laden and could represent a form of cultural chauvinism.
  The objection sought should address this criticism and provide a reason to believe that such methods don't necessarily distort the understanding of other cultures.

Answer analysis:
  A: This could imply that the multicultural education approach is futile, but it doesn't argue against the criticism.
  B: It doesn't address the main criticism regarding the Western scientific perspective.
  C: This shows a counter-example to the critics' claim about adopting perspectives and methods of the culture being studied.
  D: This focuses on understanding Western culture and not on the main criticism about understanding other cultures.
  E: It reiterates the general aim of multicultural education, but doesn't argue against the specific criticism.

Based on the analysis, C provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education states that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western and value-laden, leading to a distortion of understanding. To find the strongest objection, we should look for a statement that addresses this criticism directly.

  A: This statement could strengthen the argument rather than object to it because it supports the idea that the Western perspective cannot fully understand other cultures.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the criticism raised regarding the second version of multicultural education.
  C: This statement points out that some non-Western societies also use their value systems when studying other cultures, showing that the criticism of the second version may not be a uniquely Western problem, and could possibly be shared among different cultures.
  D: This statement is not directly related to the criticism and does not provide a strong objection.
  E: This statement reiterates a claim made in the passage rather than objecting to the criticism.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  A: This would strengthen the criticism instead of objecting to it.
  B: This is irrelevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  C: This shows that non-Western societies might also have a biased approach, which is relevant but not the strongest objection.
  D: This is not directly relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  E: Genuine understanding is one of the goals of multicultural education. The statement challenges the claim that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied is necessary, which is the main point of the criticism. Therefore, this is the strongest objection to the criticism.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education states that the methods of examination are still Western-focused and value-laden. According to the objection, real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.

  A: Irrelevant to the criticism of the second version. It talks about impossibility, not about countering the criticism.
  B: Irrelevant as it talks about similarities amongst non-Western societies, instead of addressing the criticism towards the second version's methods.
  C: Suggests there are non-Western societies that use their own value systems to study different cultures, which may counter the criticism that Western methods only distort the understanding of other cultures.
  D: This statement focuses on understanding of Western society's achievements rather than addressing the criticism of the second version's approach to understanding other cultures.
  E: It states the goal of multicultural education, but does not address the criticism of the second version's methods.

The answer is C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still uses methods from the Western scientific perspective and heritage, which involves a commitment to certain values and may distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.

To find the strongest objection to this criticism, look for an answer choice that either undermines the assumption that the Western scientific methods are distorting or provides a justification for their use in understanding other cultures.

A: This choice might actually strengthen the criticism, as it implies that even attempting to adopt another culture's perspective is impossible.
B: This choice isn't relevant to the issue of Western scientific methods being used to study other cultures.
C: This choice suggests that non-Western societies also study other cultures using their own values, which somewhat undermines the criticism. 
D: This choice focuses on understanding one's own culture, which isn't relevant to the criticism about understanding other cultures.
E: This choice reiterates the importance of understanding other cultures, but doesn't address the specific criticism about the use of Western scientific methods.

The best choice among the given options is C, as it provides evidence that non-Western cultures similarly use their own values when studying other cultures, weakening the criticism that Western scientific methods are uniquely distorting.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The second version of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
- Critics argue that this version still uses methods derived from the Western scientific perspective, which makes it not essentially different from the first version.
- To find an objection to this criticism, we need to find a choice that weakens the argument against the second version of multicultural education.

Analysis of choices:
A: This choice states that one cannot adopt another culture's perspectives and methods unless they are a part of that culture; this could weaken the argument that understanding other cultures should happen only by adopting their perspectives and methods.

B: Even if many non-Western societies have similar value systems, this doesn't counter the criticism that the second version can't understand them using a Western scientific approach.

C: This choice, about non-Western societies studying other cultures with their own value systems, doesn't address the flaw in the second version of multicultural education.

D: This choice talks about how Western societies' students understand their culture and its achievements, which is not directly related to the criticisms of the second version of multicultural education.

E: This statement agrees with the critics' point, as it emphasizes the need for genuine understanding of another culture. It doesn't provide objection to the criticism.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.
Response 0:

  The passage states that the use of proverbs depends on the individual speaker and the social context, and that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community (first paragraph). This suggests that the way a proverb is used depends on the community it is used in.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that proverbs serve multiple purposes in Mexican American communities, including the instruction of the young, regulation of peer-group relationships, and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity. Therefore, the way a proverb is used depends on the context it is used in, which is shaped by the community.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that the meaning of a proverb depends on the individual speaker and the social context. It also mentions that Mexican American communities frequently use proverbs as a teaching tool, especially for regulating peer-group relationships and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity. This suggests that the use of proverbs depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought process:
  - The passage talks about the use of proverbs in Mexican American communities.
  - It is mentioned that each use of a proverb can vary depending on the speaker and the social context.
  - Proverbs often serve a didactic purpose and are used for the instruction of the young.
  - The passage discusses the use of proverbs for regulating peer-group relationships and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity.
  - It also talks about proverbs being a vehicle for the transmission of language and culture.
  
From the given choices,
  A: The passage contradicts this statement by discussing how proverbs serve a didactic purpose and regulate norms.
  B: This statement aligns with the discussion about proverbs' meaning depending on the individual and context, as well as being shaped by the larger community.
  C: While regulating peer-group relationships is one aspect of proverb use, the passage does not say it is the most frequent use.
  D: The passage mentions proverbs help transmit language, but it does not say they are often used specifically for teaching languages.
  E: This statement is supported by the passage talking about proverbs serving multiple functions such as instruction, regulation of relationships, and fostering ethnicity consciousness.

Answer: Based on the passage, option B is the most strongly suggested statement about the use of proverbs.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: The author's primary aim in the passage is to

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.
  D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.
  E: "El Corrido de Kiansis" was composed someone not from the Border region.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage states that "The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another." This suggests that certain lines occur in all corridos. Furthermore, it mentions that "In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity." 

Based on this information, the inference that the passage provides the most support for is:

  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that corridos, such as "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez", were sung at social gatherings to serve and strengthen the cohesiveness of Border communities. It also states that corridos are composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, and provides the example of the corrido's formal closing verse or despedida. 

  Therefore, the statement that most corrido variants have the same despedida (D) is supported by the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle suggests that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility, based on economic incentives and disincentives.
  Choices A, B, C, and D all involve individuals making decisions based on the economic incentives or disincentives they face.
  Choice E involves a worker physically assaulting their former supervisor due to an unjust dismissal, which is an impulsive action not based on economic incentives or disincentives.
  Therefore, choice E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thoughts:
  A: Rational response due to the low chance of detection and reduced taxes.
  B: Rational response since the motorist avoids a high risk of penalty.
  C: Rational decision by the industrialist because the fine is lower than the cost of treatment.
  D: Rational response due to high inflation levels making it difficult for the official to support her family.
  E: A worker assaulting his supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives since it is impulsive and not driven by economics.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle says that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  A: This is rational because it's based on perceived likelihood and potential penalty.
  B: This is rational because the cost of losing the driver's license is higher than the benefit of speeding.
  C: This is rational because the cost of treatment is higher than the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: This is rational because the benefit of the bribes outweighs the risk of prosecution due to the urgent need for more income.
  E: This is an impulsive action based on anger and frustration, not a rational economic choice.
  The answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
A: This example shows a rational response to economic incentives because the waiter believes the chance of getting caught is low, and he can save money on taxes.
B: This example also shows a rational response to economic disincentives because the motorist avoids speeding to prevent the loss of her driver's license.
C: This is a rational response to economic incentives because the industrialist continues with illegal activities as it is costlier to treat the pollutant than to pay the fine.
D: This decision is based on a rational response to economic incentives because the government official risks prosecution in order to support her family due to inadequate salary.
E: This example involves a worker attacking his supervisor due to a belief of unfair dismissal. This is not a rational economic decision as it does not consider the potential legal consequences and is instead driven by emotion.

Answer: E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 4:
Thought:
A: The waiter is maximizing his utility by not reporting tip income and avoiding higher taxes - rational response.
B: The motorist avoids speeding to minimize the risk of losing her license - rational response.
C: The industrialist decides that illegally discharging the pollutant is more economically beneficial (higher utility) than treating it - rational response.
D: The government official solicits bribes to support herself and her family despite potential prosecution - rational response.
E: The worker physically assaults his supervisor as a response to unfair dismissal, an impulsive act that might result in legal consequences - least rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage explains that a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives occurs when an individual chooses an action that maximizes their expected utility, given the likelihood of various outcomes.
  - A: Concealing tips: The waiter calculates a higher expected utility from hiding income.
  - B: Avoiding speeding: The motorist calculates a higher expected utility from not speeding due to potential consequences.
  - C: Polluting: The industrialist calculates a higher expected utility from not treating the pollutant due to costs.
  - D: Soliciting bribes: The government official calculates a higher expected utility taking bribes due to financial necessity.
  - E: Assaulting supervisor: This action does not involve calculated economic incentives or disincentives and seems impulsive rather than rational.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
A rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be one that reflects a decision made with the utility maximization principle in mind. In other words, a rational individual would weigh the potential benefits and consequences of their actions before choosing one that maximizes their satisfaction or expected utility.

Analysis of each choice:
A: This choice is rational because the waiter weighs the likelihood of being detected and the penalty against the potential tax savings.
B: This choice is rational because the motorist considers the likelihood of being caught speeding and the consequence of losing her driver's license.
C: This choice is rational because the industrialist compares the costs of treating the pollutant with the fine for discharging it illegally.
D: This choice is rational because the government official considers the financial need of her family and the risk of prosecution.
E: This choice is not rational because the worker's decision to assault the supervisor seems not to be based on a consideration of the potential consequences or benefits; it appears to be an impulsive decision driven by emotions, not an economically-driven rational decision.

Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
- Choice A involves a person responding to incentives to avoid detection and reduce tax.
- Choice B highlights an individual modifying behavior in response to law enforcement.
- Choice C depicts a case where an individual is weighing the economic costs of treatment against a fine.
- Choice D represents someone engaging in illegal activity to make ends meet due to adverse economic circumstances.
- Choice E presents an act of violence provoked by an unfair situation which is not necessarily an economic incentive or disincentive.

Considering the options, choice E is the least rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.

  The passage discusses the three different musical styles of Schoenberg.
  He began with late-Romantic music, then pushed the unstable harmonies until they became atonal, and lastly, developed the 12-tone technique.
  The passage states that Schoenberg pushed the harmonies because he felt it was the next inevitable step in music, meaning a natural progression.
  The passage also mentions that he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order, which implies a natural progression as well.
  
  Therefore, the statement that the author would most likely agree with is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The passage mentions that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles.
- He began with late-Romantic harmonies, then pushed those harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis (second style), and finally developed the 12-tone technique (third style).
- The three styles are described as acknowledging tradition while venturing into new territory.
- The author states that Schoenberg developed the 12-tone technique to bring order to nontonal music, implying that this technique may have naturally evolved from the second style.
- Schoenberg's progression through styles is presented as necessary for his musical expression and seen as the next inevitable step in musical development.

Based on this analysis, the author would most likely agree with:
Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought process:

The passage talks about the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg evolved his music. It states that Schoenberg first began with late-Romantic music, then pushed the unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a way of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music. It also says he did this, in part, because it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and because he needed it to express his emotions.

From this, we can infer that the author would agree with the statement that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. So the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Schoenberg's first style is described as late-Romantic, full of shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The author notes that Schoenberg pushed these unstable harmonies in his second style until they lost their tonal basis, partly because he felt it was the next step in music history and partly to express his own emotions.
  In his third style, Schoenberg developed the 12-tone technique to bring order and stability to nontonal music.
  The passage shows these transitions as natural progressions, as Schoenberg aimed to evolve and push boundaries in music.
  Therefore, the author would likely agree that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage explains how Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles. It states that he began in the late-Romantic manner and later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. This was because he viewed it as the next inevitable step in music and to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique to bring a new system of order to non-tonal music. All styles show Schoenberg's desire to evolve, innovate, and progress in music.

  Based on this, it seems evident that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. Therefore, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

Action: Answer("A")

  The passage states that Arnold Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles. He began with late-Romantic chromatic harmonies, then pushed those harmonies until they lost their tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique to stabilize nontonal music. The passage states that Schoenberg did this partly because he saw it as the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, which suggests that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes Schoenberg's musical evolution in three stages:
  1. Late-Romantic style with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  2. Pushing unstable harmonies until they lost their tonal basis.
  3. Developing the 12-tone technique to bring a new order to nontonal music.
  
The text states:
  "Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music..."
  This statement implies that the progression from the first to the second style was a natural development.
  "...he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it."
  This statement implies that the third style was a response to the nontonal music of the second style and a natural progression towards stabilizing it.

Based on this analysis, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one. 

Action: Answer("A")

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the sociohistorical interpretation of art as a reflection of the ideals and values of the elite class. It also discusses the two ways that art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites." The author presents criticisms and nuances to the idea that art only reflects those ideals and values, mentioning that some art that goes against these values can still prevail due to various circumstances. The passage mostly critiques the simplistic understanding of the relationship between art and elite classes.

  The answer that best captures this is B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought process:
  The passage discusses how art historically was commissioned by the elite classes.
  It points out that some art endured despite the elite classes' lack of appropriate taste.
  Sociohistorical critics must engage in nuanced thinking to analyze art produced by these classes.
  The passage primarily argues that the simplistic view (art reflecting only the elites' ideals and values) is not entirely accurate.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage argues against sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes. It provides examples and explanations of how great works of art have not always been solely based on elite ideals and values. It shows that artists have sometimes found support in the margins of the establishment or had their work commissioned unwillingly by the establishment.

  The main point of the passage is that sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art solely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are too simplistic. 
  
  Therefore, the best choice is B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the sociohistorical interpretations of art focusing on how art was commissioned by the elite classes. It presents the view of the sociohistorical critic that art reflects the ideals and values of the elite. The passage then talks about how this interpretation has limitations and issues, as sometimes art commissioned by the elite doesn't align with their views.

  The main point centers on the limitations of the sociohistorical interpretation of art and how it may be overly simplistic. Therefore, the answer is B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the sociohistorical interpretations of the connection between art and the elite classes. It highlights that high art is often produced by and for the elites, and there are two ways this happens. The author mainly criticizes the sociohistorical critics' views about how art reflects the ideals of the elite, as these critics ignore other possibilities and the complexities of the relationship between art and the elites. Hence, the main point is that these interpretations are overly simplistic.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses sociohistorical interpretations of art and how these interpretations focus on how art is produced by and for political and social elites. It also criticizes these interpretations for being too simplistic, as art production and patronage can be complex and varied. The passage raises points that challenge these interpretations, such as the varying taste of elite classes and the possibility of artists' subversion.

  The main point seems to focus on criticizing sociohistorical interpretations and pointing out their oversimplification. 
  
  Therefore, the best answer should reflect this criticism.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the ways art has been commissioned by elites and the sociohistorical analysis of art, which emphasizes the role of elite classes in influencing art. The author also brings up arguments about how such critics must consider the possibility of hidden or subconscious influence in art that doesn't overtly align with elite ideals. The main point of this passage seems to address the complexities of sociohistorical interpretations of art and the elite's influence.
  
  Answer B focuses on the critique of the overly simplistic nature of sociohistorical interpretations and seems to be the most accurate expression of the main point.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the ways in which sociohistorical interpretations of art have been produced by and for the elite. It argues that such critics must deal with apparent contradictions in art commissioned by the establishment and its enduring value. The main point seems to be a critique of these sociohistorical interpretations as overly simplistic or having to use intricate analysis to make sense of conflicting cases.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways the elite produced art and how sociohistorical interpretations focus on the second way to analyze the ideology of the elite. The passage also highlights the limitations of this approach, given that the elite's taste didn't always produce enduring art, and some art against elite values was paid for by them unwillingly. It points out that the sociohistorical critic must rely on Freudian analysis to justify this approach.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the sociohistorical interpretations of art and how the ideals and values of the elite classes may be reflected in the art they commission. However, it also mentions that not all art that endures is a direct reflection of the ideals of the elite classes. The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics may use a Freudian analysis to justify their claim while dismissing conflicting evidence.

  Based on these ideas, the most accurate main point of the passage would be related to the limitations or shortcomings of sociohistorical interpretations of art in relation to the ideals of elite classes.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research
  B: establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author connects increased size and monopoly power by stating that increasing returns to scale creates a natural tendency toward monopoly, because larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller businesses.
  To undermine this connection, we need to find an option that challenges the idea that a larger business's increasing returns to scale directly lead to monopoly power.

  A: This option shows that regional monopoly power can occur even without the largest size, but it does not challenge the connection between size and monopoly power itself.
  B: This option focuses on worker's salaries, which does not directly address the connection between size and monopoly power.
  C: This option talks about collusion, an alternative way for firms to exert monopoly power, but it does not challenge the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: This option highlights a variation in the size needed for increasing returns, but it does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  E: This option suggests that further specialization of workers can negatively impact productivity gains, thus challenging the idea that larger businesses with more specialized workers will always lead to monopolistic power.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author draws a connection between increased size and monopoly power by stating that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to an industry being dominated by just a few players. To undermine this connection, we need to find an option that weakens the relationship between increased size and monopoly power.
  
  A: This option suggests that even smaller businesses can exert monopoly power, which weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This option talks about workers' salaries, which doesn't directly relate to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This option shows a negative aspect of industries being dominated by only a few players but doesn't weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author connects increased size with monopoly power by stating that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly because large businesses can achieve larger scale and lower costs than smaller businesses. We need to find an answer that undermines this connection.

  A: This talks about the monopoly power in a specific region while there are larger businesses in other regions. However, this still supports that the larger businesses hold monopoly power.
  
  B: This deals with the workers' salaries, not the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  
  C: Collusion between a few businesses to set prices high is a different means of exerting power and doesn't undermine the connection the author makes between increased size and monopoly power.
  
  D: This indicates the size required to achieve increasing returns varies across industries. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  
  E: This mentions that increased specialization comes with other factors offsetting productivity gains. This means that the increased size might not necessarily lead to monopolistic behavior.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The passage discusses the connection between increased size and monopoly power by stating that larger firms can achieve greater scale and lower costs, which can lead to monopolies as they drive smaller firms out of business.
- To undermine this connection, we should look for an answer that challenges the assumption that increased size or specialization leads to monopolies.

Analysis of choices:
  A: This statement shows that local monopolies can exist even if there are larger businesses in other regions. However, it doesn't necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This statement talks about worker salaries and their task specialization but does not address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This statement supports the idea that fewer players lead to monopolistic behavior, and thus, does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: While the size needed for increasing returns to scale may vary, this statement does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power as it still acknowledges that larger businesses can potentially achieve monopoly power.
  E: This statement challenges the assumption that specialization always leads to productivity gains and monopoly power. It shows that there may be factors that offset the benefits of increased specialization, making it harder for larger firms to achieve monopoly power.

Based on the analysis, option E most undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("E")

  The correct answer is E, as it undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The author's connection is that increased size leads to monopoly power. We need to find an option that undermines this connection.

A: This option does not undermine the connection because it still shows monopoly power, even if not on a global scale.
B: This option is about salaries, not the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
C: This option reinforces the connection by suggesting that a few players have a monopoly-like control over prices.
D: This option does not necessarily undermine the connection - increased size still leads to monopoly power, but the exact size might differ between industries.
E: This option undermines the connection because it suggests that there might be diminishing returns to scale from specialization, making it harder for businesses to become monopolies.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author draws a connection between increased size and monopoly power by stating that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business with their larger scale and lower costs.
  The connection would be undermined if a factor contradicts the notion that larger firms in an industry will necessarily lead to monopoly power.

Choice Analysis:
  A: This choice provides an example where businesses may have different levels of monopoly power in different geographical regions, which weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This choice talks about worker's salary, which is not related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  C: This choice talks about collusion among few industry players, which is not directly contradicting the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: This choice states that business size may differ for different industries to achieve increasing returns to scale, but it doesn't undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  E: This choice indicates that further specialization may not result in increased productivity due to other factors, which weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author connects increased size with monopoly power by arguing that bigger firms can achieve larger scale and lower costs, which in turn allows them to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to monopolies. To undermine this connection, we need to find an alternative explanation for monopoly power or disprove the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

  Choice A suggests that monopoly power can exist even when there are larger businesses in other geographical regions. This undermines the assumption that increased size is the only factor leading to monopoly power.
  
  Choice B focuses on workers' salaries, which is not directly relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  
  Choice C discusses collusion among businesses, which is another way that monopoly power can occur without necessarily being driven by increased size.
  
  Choice D is irrelevant because it addresses the size needed for increasing returns to scale, not the connection between size and monopoly power.
  
  Choice E focuses on specialized workers and productivity gains, but it does not address the connection between size and monopoly power directly.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: The passage stat es that the writing on clay tablets found in Uruk
Choices:
  A: was not deciphered by archaeologists until 1992
  B: used relatively few pictographic symbols
  C: eventually evolved into a more abstract and flexible linguistic system
  D: transcribed a language that was commonly spoken along the Jordan and nearby rivers
  E: transcribed a language that was much older than archaeologists would have expected
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the clay tablets found in Uruk used relatively few pictographs and instead used numerous abstract symbols. This information can be found in the following sentence: "Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used." 
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: used relatively few pictographic symbols.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Thought:
- Passage A mentions the concept of scientific research and the search for evidence that would disprove theories. It talks about making predictions and the need for auxiliary premises.
- Passage B provides examples of predicting planet orbits, specifically Uranus and Mercury. It illustrates the process of revising auxiliary assumptions to align with observations and how Einstein's theory of relativity led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.

The answer is D: predicting a planet's orbit, as this concept is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B with the examples of Uranus and Mercury.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find a choice that is mentioned in Passage A and illustrated in Passage B.
  
  Passage A:
  - Karl Popper's philosophy of science is based on negative evidence
  - Positive evidence has no value, while negative evidence disproves hypotheses
  - A scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own
  - Auxiliary premises are needed to derive a theory's predictions

  Passage B:
  - Astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions
  - The prediction was incorrect and they concluded that there must be another planet, Neptune
  - Later, astronomers tried to predict the orbit of Mercury
  - The predictions were not borne out, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory and increased confidence in Einstein's theory

Analysis:
  A: repudiating an experimental result - This is not mentioned in Passage A nor illustrated in Passage B.
  B: revising a theory - This is not explicitly mentioned in Passage A, but Passage B illustrates it as astronomers adjusted their assumptions and eventually adopted Einstein's theory.
  C: disproving a theory - This is related to Popper's ideas in Passage A, but this is not exactly what is illustrated in Passage B; rather, it's a gradual process of refining and replacing the theories. The connection is weak.
  D: predicting a planet's orbit - This is not explicitly mentioned in Passage A, but it is discussed and illustrated in Passage B, focusing on the predictions for Uranus and Mercury.
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment - This is discussed in Passage A, but it's not illustrated in Passage B.

  Based on the analysis, the choice that is mentioned in Passage A and illustrated in Passage B is D: predicting a planet's orbit.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A focuses on Popper's philosophy of science, emphasizing the power of negative evidence. It also states that Popper's use of logical asymmetry does not capture the actual situation scientists face regarding predictions.

  Passage B provides examples regarding the predictions of the orbits of Uranus and Mercury. It describes the astronomers' struggle with predictions, auxiliary assumptions, and revisions to their theories.

  Let's analyze the choices in relation to both passages:

  A: Repudiating an experimental result. This is not mentioned in passage A nor illustrated in passage B.
  B: Revising a theory. Passage A discusses scientific research involving bold theories and searching for evidence. Passage B illustrates the process of revising auxiliary assumptions.
  C: Disproving a theory. Passage A talks about the power of negative evidence and how it disproves hypotheses. Passage B discusses failures in predictions, not necessarily disproving a theory.
  D: Predicting a planet's orbit. Passage A does not directly mention predicting a planet's orbit. Passage B illustrates the prediction of orbits for Uranus and Mercury.
  E: Theories that are not testable by experiment. This is not mentioned in passage A nor illustrated in passage B.

  Considering the above analysis, the correct answer is the one mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses negative evidence in the context of scientific research and Popper's view on the matter. It mentions the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence, and how negative evidence can disprove a hypothesis. Passage B provides examples concerning Uranus' orbit prediction and how the discovery of Neptune, Mercury's orbit prediction, and the introduction of Einstein's general theory of relativity all played a significant role in scientific thinking.

  Let's analyze each choice to find the correct answer:
  A: No repudiation of an experimental result is mentioned in Passage A, nor illustrated in Passage B.
  B: Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence and implies that a theory may be revised or falsified based on such evidence, while in Passage B, when the auxiliary assumptions are not aligned, the scientists revised their hypotheses to better align with their observations. This could be considered as revising a theory.
  C: There's no explicit mention of disproving a theory in Passage A, and Passage B doesn't illustrate disproving a theory.
  D: Passage B discusses predicting a planet's orbit (Uranus and Mercury) using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, while Passage A does not mention a specific topic about predictions but talks about the broader context of scientific research.
  E: Passage A mention theories that are scientific only if they make testable predictions, while Passage B doesn't discuss any theories that are not testable by experiment.

  Based on the analysis, choice B is mentioned in Passage A and illustrated in Passage B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence in the context of scientific research and the importance of testable predictions.
  Passage B provides two examples where scientists predict the orbits of planets (Uranus and Mercury) using theories and auxiliary assumptions. Both situations involve the modification of assumptions and the adaptation of theories (Newton and Einstein).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We are searching for an idea mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.

Passage A key points:
  - Importance of negative evidence
  - A theory counts as scientific if it makes testable predictions
  - Positive and negative evidence are not conclusive

Passage B illustrations:
  - Predicting the orbit of Uranus: Newton's laws + auxiliary assumptions
  - Error in predicted orbit: astronomers revise auxiliary assumptions
  - Discovery of Neptune supports revised assumptions
  - Predicting the orbit of Mercury: Newton's laws, hypothesize about Vulcan
  - Failure to find Vulcan, replacing Newton's laws with Einstein's general theory of relativity

Comparing the points and illustrations:
  - Predicting a planet's orbit is mentioned in passage B (Uranus and Mercury examples)

The answer is D: predicting a planet's orbit.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence in scientific research. It points out that theories cannot be proven by positive evidence but can be refuted with negative evidence.
  Passage B provides examples of the predictions of the orbits of Uranus and Mercury. When the predictions were incorrect, the assumptions and auxiliary premises were revised, leading to the discovery of Neptune and the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.

  A: repudiating an experimental result - This is not mentioned in Passage A nor illustrated in Passage B.
  B: revising a theory - Passage A talks about disproving a theory, but not about revising it. However, revising a theory is illustrated in Passage B with the astronomers' changed assumptions.
  C: disproving a theory - This is mentioned in Passage A, but not illustrated in Passage B, as Passage B discusses revising auxiliary assumptions rather than disproving a theory.
  D: predicting a planet's orbit - This is not mentioned in Passage A, but is illustrated in Passage B with the examples of Uranus and Mercury.
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment - This is not mentioned in Passage A nor illustrated in Passage B.

Solution: The correct choice should be an event occurring in both passages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:

Passage A talks about the power of negative evidence, positive evidence, and the logical asymmetry between them. It also mentions the process of scientific research with a focus on generating bold theories and seeking evidence to disprove them.

Passage B describes astronomers' attempts to predict the orbits of Uranus and Mercury using Newton's laws, along with auxiliary assumptions, and latter discoveries of Neptune and the impact of Einstein's general theory of relativity on the understanding of Mercury's orbit.

We need to find an aspect that is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.

A: repudiating an experimental result - Passage B talks about adjusting predictions and theories, but not repudiating experimental results. So not A.

B: revising a theory - Passage A discusses generating bold theories and searching for evidence that would disprove them. Passage B illustrates the revision of predictions and assumptions concerning planetary orbits based on new data and the introduction of Einstein's general theory of relativity. So option B is correct.

C: disproving a theory - Passage B demonstrates the revision of beliefs regarding planetary orbits and Newton's laws. Although it shows the shift towards Einstein's theory, it's not a direct disproof of a theory. So not C.

D: predicting a planet's orbit - Passage A does not discuss predicting a planet's orbit. So not D.

E: theories that are not testable by experiment - Passage A does mention that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must make predictions that are testable. However, passage B does not illustrate theories that are not testable by experiment. So not E.

Based on the analysis, the correct option is B: revising a theory.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A mainly discusses the role of positive and negative evidence in scientific research and Karl Popper's view about it.
  Passage B provides examples of astronomers predicting the orbits of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and making adjustments when those predictions were not observed.

Matching the choices with the passages:
  A: Passage A does not specifically mention repudiating experimental results, while Passage B does not provide examples of repudiation.
  B: Revising theories is not directly mentioned in Passage A. Passage B discusses astronomers adjusting assumptions and eventually switching to Einstein's theory, which can be seen as revising a theory.
  C: Disproving a theory is a central point in Passage A and is illustrated by the process in Passage B when considering other planets in the vicinity or errors in the auxiliary assumptions, ultimately leading to the rejection of Newton's theory.
  D: Predicting a planet's orbit is not directly mentioned in Passage A, but in Passage B, it is demonstrated through the examples of Uranus and Mercury.
  E: Theories that are not testable by experiment are mentioned in Passage A when discussing Popper's view that a theory counts as scientific only if it makes testable predictions, while Passage B does not provide examples of those non-testable theories.
  
Based on the matching, C: disproving a theory is the choice that is discussed in Passage A and illustrated with examples in Passage B.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought process:
  Passage A discusses the power of negative evidence and how it cannot adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. 
  Passage B presents examples of astronomers trying to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws, and how the failures in prediction led to different explanations and outcomes (discovering Neptune and rejecting Newton's theory for Einstein's theory).

Comparison:
  A: Repudiating an experimental result is not mentioned or illustrated in both passages.
  B: Revising a theory is illustrated in passage B by revising auxiliary assumptions and rejecting Newton's theory in favor of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
  C: Disproving a theory is mentioned in passage A (negative evidence in Popper's philosophy) but not illustrated in passage B.
  D: Predicting a planet's orbit is mentioned in passage B with examples of Uranus and Mercury.
  E: Theories that are not testable by experiment are mentioned in passage A (Popper's view on scientific theories) but not illustrated in passage B.

Conclusion:
  The answer is D: predicting a planet's orbit, as it is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the flaws in Mario Garcia's study but it also discusses the importance of understanding the political implications of variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, which help to create variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account, in part, for variations in ethnic consciousness.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, believing effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment (lines 33-36).
  The passage states that because of her interest and skill as a performer, Dunham participated in the dances herself and managed to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices (lines 37-40).
  The long-standing view of detachment in data-gathering is now fortunately recognized as unrealistic (line 36).
  Thus, the author would likely agree that the colleagues were incorrect in their assumption about detachment in research.
  The answer is D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
    The passage states that Dunham's colleagues advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, because of the prevailing view that effective data gathering should be conducted from a position of complete detachment. However, Dunham's approach of immersing herself in the dances allowed her to comprehend complex cultural practices and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. This suggests that the author disagrees with the colleagues' assumption about complete detachment in data gathering.

Choice:
    D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances as they believed effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. Dunham's success came from diverging from this methodology and participating in the dances herself to fully comprehend them. The passage says that the long-standing detachment view is now recognized as unrealistic. Based on this, the author would likely agree with a statement highlighting the incorrectness of the detachment advice that her colleagues gave.

  Choice A acknowledges the possible injury risk but not the main issue regarding complete detachment.
  Choice B focuses on initial caution, which is not the main point the author would agree with.
  Choice C suggests that increased personal investment enhances scientific rigor, which is not directly mentioned in the passage.
  Choice D correctly points out that the colleagues were incorrect in assuming researchers gather data in an entirely objective manner, aligning with the author's view on the detachment approach.
  Choice E focuses on the assumption about the scientific rigor rather than the detachment of data gathering.

  Choice D focuses on the misconception of complete detachment and is the most aligned with the author's view.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states: "Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing... they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment."
  
  The author suggests that the colleagues' view on complete detachment was incorrect and unrealistic.

  The closest answer choice to this idea is:

  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that Dunham's colleagues believed in complete detachment for data gathering, but Dunham's success came from her participation in the dances. The long-standing view mentioned in the text is now recognized as unrealistic.
  
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree that the colleagues were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  
  The answer is D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author suggests that the colleagues recommended Dunham to be detached from the dances.
  These colleagues subscribed to the "long-standing view" that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  However, the author describes this view as unrealistic.
  Dunham's success in understanding the dances as complex cultural practices was partly due to her participation in the dances.
  This means the author is more likely to disagree with the colleagues' recommendation.

Answer: D. They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 53 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Thought:
  The primary concern with CFCs is how they deplete the ozone layer by breaking down and reacting with ozone when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  A suitable replacement for CFCs should not undergo the same chemical reactions that lead to ozone depletion.
  Examining the available choices with this criterion, we can select the most useful experiment.

Choice A: If a chemical reacts with other forms of oxygen, it doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't damage the ozone layer. This choice is not useful.

Choice B: If a chemical reacts with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere, it doesn't specifically address its impact on the ozone layer. This choice is not useful.

Choice C: A reaction with chlorine doesn't necessarily indicate whether the chemical would damage the ozone layer. This choice is not useful.

Choice D: Sharing properties with chlorine doesn't necessarily mean that the chemical would have the same impact on the ozone layer. This choice is not useful.

Choice E: This choice specifically addresses the primary concern about CFCs, as a chemical breaking down in ultraviolet radiation is what causes ozone depletion. If a chemical does not break down when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, it would be a suitable replacement for CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. This choice is most useful.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The main issue with CFCs in the passage is that when they break down in the stratosphere due to ultraviolet radiation, they create chlorine, which in turn depletes the ozone layer. Therefore, to find a suitable replacement for CFCs, we need to determine if a chemical would not create such harmful byproducts when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.

  A: Whether the chemical reacts with other forms of oxygen is not the main concern for ozone depletion.
  B: Reacting with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere is not relevant to ozone layer depletion.
  C: Reacting with chlorine is not the main concern, as the problem is the production of chlorine from CFCs.
  D: Sharing properties with chlorine is irrelevant to whether the chemical contributes to ozone depletion.
  E: Testing if the chemical breaks down when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, which is the main cause of CFC's ozone depletion mentioned in the passage, is the most relevant test.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that CFCs damage the ozone layer because when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which then reacts with ozone and destroys it.
  To find a chemical that could replace CFCs and not damage the ozone layer, the experiment should determine if the chemical won't break down into ozone-damaging components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought process:
  - Using the passage's information, CFCs are dangerous because they break down into chlorine due to ultraviolet radiation, and chlorine depletes the ozone layer.
  - When looking for an alternative, the most important aspect is that it doesn't cause ozone depletion.
  - The passage states that chlorine depletes ozone when it reacts with it.
  - Thus, an alternative chemical should not release chlorine or any ozone-depleting constituent under the influence of ultraviolet radiation.

Answer: E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that CFCs contribute to ozone depletion by breaking down into their constituent elements in the stratosphere under exposure to ultraviolet radiation, leading to an increase in chlorine concentration and the subsequent destruction of ozone molecules.
  To determine if a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, it would be essential to know whether the chemical would release chlorine or a similar ozone-depleting element when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.

  Choice A: This does not specifically address whether the chemical would release an ozone-depleting element or not.
  Choice B: The lower atmosphere is not where ozone depletion primarily occurs.
  Choice C: Reacting with chlorine does not address the issue of releasing chlorine or similar ozone-depleting elements.
  Choice D: Chemical properties shared with chlorine might not necessarily indicate the potential to release chlorine or ozone-depleting elements when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.
  Choice E: This option directly addresses the concern of whether the chemical would release any ozone-depleting elements when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.

  Therefore, E is the most relevant choice in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Key points: 
  - CFCs were damaging the ozone layer.
  - Molina and Rowland found that CFCs diffuse upwards into the stratosphere, break down into constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  - The increase in chlorine concentration destroys the ozone layer due to a chemical reaction.
  - We need to find out which experiment would be helpful in determining if a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

Looking at the answer choices:

Option A: It does not specifically mention ozone layer protection, so it's not the best option.

Option B: It talks about the lower atmosphere, which does not directly link to the ozone layer's protection.

Option C: Knowing the reaction with chlorine does not provide information about whether the replacement chemical would damage the ozone layer or not.

Option D: Sharing chemical properties with chlorine might indicate a similar reaction, but does not directly indicate if the ozone layer would be protected or not.

Option E: This option relates to the key point that CFCs break down into constituent elements, including chlorine, under ultraviolet radiation, leading to ozone layer depletion. If the alternative chemical does not create ozone-depleting elements when it breaks down under ultraviolet radiation, it could potentially replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

Conclusion: Option E is the most relevant experiment to determine if a chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer. When CFCs break down in the stratosphere due to ultraviolet radiation, they release chlorine, which is devastating to the ozone layer. A crucial aspect of the chemical reaction is the breakdown of CFCs into chlorine. So, to find a replacement for CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, we would need to determine whether the chemical would release elements that can destroy ozone when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.

  Answer E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, would help determine if the chemical poses a similar threat to the ozone layer as CFCs do.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that CFCs contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer when they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  The issue with CFCs is their reaction with ozone, which destroys ozone while regenerating chlorine atoms.
  To determine if a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, we would want to see if it avoids these harmful reactions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that CFCs are damaging to the ozone layer because they break down into their constituent elements like chlorine when exposed to massive ultraviolet radiation. This chemical process destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.

  To find a replacement, we need to test a chemical that does not show the same hazardous behavior when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.

  Choice E suggests testing a chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, which is the key process that leads to the depletion of the ozone layer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The main concern with CFCs is that they break down into constituents including chlorine, which destroys the ozone layer.
  A suitable replacement for CFCs should not cause damage to the ozone layer. 
  Therefore, a suitable experiment would be one that tests whether the new chemical breaks down into constituents that can cause harm to the ozone layer when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  Answer choice E tests the new chemical to see if it breaks down when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought process:
- Passage A describes disturbing forces as something that needs to be taken into account when generating predictions in scientific theories.
- In Passage B:
  - The discovery of Uranus led to an incorrect prediction of its orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  - The prediction turned out to be incorrect; the astronomers then updated their assumptions and discovered Neptune.
  - Neptune's presence near Uranus influenced the calculations about the orbit of Uranus.
- Neptune can be considered a disturbing force in this context, as it affected the predictions of Uranus' orbit.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  In Passage A, a disturbing force is described as something that affects predictions or experiments (line 26). 
  In Passage B, Neptune is mentioned as the planet that affects the predicted orbit of Uranus due to its gravitational influence.
  Therefore, the presence of Neptune can be considered a disturbing force as described in Passage A.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions "disturbing forces" which refers to factors that can affect predictions based on scientific theories. In Passage B, we need to find an example that illustrates a "disturbing force."

  The passage describes how the orbit of Uranus was predicted inaccurately due to incorrect assumptions about the existence of other planets. When the astronomers changed their assumptions and took the presence of another planet, Neptune, into account, their predictions aligned with observations. 

  Thus, Neptune was the "disturbing force" that affected the initial predictions of Uranus's orbit.

  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  In passage A, line 26, it states that when scientists derive a theory's predictions, they often need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Passage B describes how when astronomers made observations about the orbit of Uranus, they found that their predictions were incorrect. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. The astronomers had to change this assumption and concluded that another planet (Neptune) must be close enough to Uranus to affect its orbit. 
  This means that Neptune was the disturbing force affecting the predictions regarding Uranus' orbit.
  The answer is C: Neptune.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A refers to disturbing forces as additional "auxiliary" premises that scientists need to take into consideration when making predictions.
  In Passage B, one of the auxiliary premises involved the existence of other planets.
  Neptune was discovered because it influenced Uranus's orbit, which means it acted as a disturbing force on the original predictions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  In passage A, a disturbing force is mentioned as one of the factors that can affect the predictions made using a scientific theory.
  In passage B, the presence of Neptune was the factor that affected the predictions of Uranus' orbit based on Newton's laws.
  Therefore, Neptune is the most obvious example of a disturbing force in passage B.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A speaks about deriving a theory's predictions by using auxiliary premises, including the absence of disturbing forces. So, we are looking for a force that affects predictions. 
  In Passage B, Neptune affects the orbit of Uranus, resulting in an incorrect prediction. Therefore, Neptune can be considered as a disturbing force.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  In Passage A, line 26: "to the absence of disturbing forces"
  A disturbing force is something that affects the expected results or predictions in a scientific experiment or observation.
  Passage B describes two examples of astronomers trying to predict the orbits of planets using scientific theories. In both examples, the predicted orbits were incorrect due to other factors.
  In the case of Uranus, the presence of another planet (Neptune) was influencing its orbit and, thus, their observation of Uranus differed from their prediction.
  Neptune can be considered a "disturbing force" because it is the factor that affected the expected result of the scientists' calculations.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.  

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
- Passage A states that when deriving predictions, scientists need to consider disturbing forces (among other auxiliary premises).
- Passage B provides the example of the prediction of Uranus's orbit and how that prediction was incorrect.

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.
  B: The primary threat to the spread of digital publishing will be the widespread use of computers aud haudheld devices for reading text.
  C: The growth of digital publishing is likely to revitalize the book retail business.
  D: Any book will sell more copies ifit is published digitally thau if it is published traditionally.
  E: Digital publishing will allow publishers to substantially decrease the amount of money they allocate for advertising their books.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky's view, as stated in the passage, is that reality is the foundation of literature, but his concept of reality goes deeper than the definition of either the radical critics or the critics who believed art should stand above everyday life. The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky would completely agree with this latter position. However, he does believe that reality is more than just mundane details, so he could agree with this aspect of that view.
  
  The best answer is B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's position was that reality was the crucial source for literature, but reality encompassed more than the tangible and included the fantastic. He didn't agree with radical critics who demanded art serve a political view or utilitarian purpose. He believed that the task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of the real world and that the fantastic was important.

  A: Dostoyevsky would not agree because he didn't see the necessity of having a strong element of the fantastic; rather, he believed in intertwining it with reality.
  B: Dostoyevsky might agree because he believed the understanding of reality included the fantastic and should not be limited to just the mundane details of life.
  C: Dostoyevsky would not agree completely with this statement because although he believed in reality as a foundation, he also deemed the fantastic to be crucial.
  D: Dostoyevsky would not agree because he acknowledged the existence of both reality and the fantastic, rather than making no distinction between them.
  E: Dostoyevsky would not agree because he didn't insist that art further some societal end; he believed it should stand on its own artistic merit.

  The best choice is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discussed Dostoyevsky's own viewpoint, which is a mix of the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. Dostoyevsky agreed with the realists that reality is literature's crucial source, but also believed that reality and fantasy are intertwined and that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it. He did not support the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view or societal end.

  A: Dostoyevsky did not solely agree with the requirement that art has a strong element of the fantastic, although he believed that the fantastic must be bound up with reality.
  B: Although Dostoyevsky saw reality as more than mundane details, this statement does not precisely address his position.
  C: This statement mostly aligns with Dostoyevsky's belief that reality is the foundation of literature, but with a deeper understanding of reality that embraces the fantastic.
  D: Dostoyevsky's stance did not completely reject the distinction between reality and fantasy, but believed they could be intertwined.
  E: This statement reflects the radical critics' view that Dostoyevsky opposed.

Based on these considerations, choice C seems to be the closest to Dostoyevsky's stance.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The position that stated art should stand high above the present and everyday seems similar to what both radical critics and Dostoyevsky disagreed with.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source but his understanding of reality went deeper than the radicals, encompassing both the tangible and the fantastic.
  The first position meant that art transcended the present and the everyday, without relating it to the concrete reality or the fantastic. This position is not congruent with Dostoyevsky's view.

  Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's view is that a realist should take reality as the foundation of literature, but he also believed that reality included both the tangible and the fantastic.
  
  A: This choice is incorrect because Dostoyevsky believes that fantastic elements should be bound with reality, not that art should have a strong element of the fantastic as a separate requirement.
  B: This choice is closest to Dostoyevsky's view, as he believed in the deeper meaning of reality that included more than just mundane details.
  C: This choice is incorrect because, while Dostoyevsky believes that reality should be the foundation of literature, he also includes the fantastic elements in his understanding of reality.
  D: This choice is incorrect because Dostoyevsky does not make distinctions between reality and fantasy; he believes they should be bound together.
  E: This choice is incorrect because Dostoyevsky was against the idea that art should serve a particular political view or societal end.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality is literature's crucial source, but he also believed in incorporating the fantastic into literature.
  The first view of Russian critics states that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  This view doesn't explicitly mention the fantastic, but it also doesn't insist that art further a societal end.
  The passage doesn't suggest that Dostoyevsky would agree with the view entirely, but he might find some merit in it.
  The statement that Dostoyevsky would most likely agree with based on the passage would be that reality is more than just an enumeration of mundane details of life.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source for literature, but he also believed in no distinction between fantasy and reality. He disagreed with the notion that art should serve a particular political view or just be "useful" to society, and emphasized the importance of artistic merit. So he neither held the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday completely, nor the view that art should only be useful and serve a political view.

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: Dostoyevsky did incorporate the fantastic, but this statement doesn't address the other aspects of his view, so it's not a complete representation of his position.
  B: This statement captures the essence of Dostoyevsky's view of reality encompassing more than just mundane details and his belief in intertwining reality and fantasy.
  C: Dostoyevsky did believe that reality must be the foundation of literature, but it doesn't represent his entire view.
  D: This statement is somewhat the opposite of what Dostoyevsky believed (he thought there should be no distinction between reality and fantasy).
  E: This statement aligns more with the radical critics' view than Dostoyevsky's.

The best answer representing Dostoyevsky's position in response to the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday reality would be B, as it encompasses the most significant aspects of his perspective.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source but also considered the fantastic as an important aspect within reality. He rejected the idea that art should only serve a political or societal purpose and focused on the artistry of a work being the ability to write well, expressing thoughts, characters, and images. 

  From the passage, we can infer the following about Dostoyevsky's position on the statement that art should stand high above the present and everyday:
  A: Dostoyevsky does appreciate the fantastic element but does not imply that this is the only reason for agreeing with this view.
  B: This is true since he sees reality as more than just tangible and mundane details.
  C: This statement contradicts Dostoyevsky's belief that reality is literature's crucial source.
  D: This statement is not accurate, as Dostoyevsky does make a distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: This statement is not aligned with Dostoyevsky's beliefs since he rejected the idea of art only serving a societal end.

  Therefore, the answer should be B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thoughts:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on art and states that he took a third position between two opposing Russian critic views: one that states art should stand above the present and everyday, the other that it should connect to reality to help create a new society. Dostoyevsky believes that reality is important for art, but he thinks reality goes beyond just tangible things and may include the fantastic. He disagrees with the utilitarian view that art must serve a societal purpose or be politically aligned. 

  What Dostoyevsky would most likely agree on regarding the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday would be related to the concept of reality in literature, without insisting on a societal end.

  Let's analyze the options:

    A: It mentions the element of the fantastic, but Dostoyevsky doesn't say that art should stand high above the present because of it. So this option is not accurate.
  
    B: This option explains that reality is more than just the mundane details of life, which seems to align with Dostoyevsky's view of reality in literature. This option seems to be accurate.

    C: This option contradicts Dostoyevsky's third position. He does agree that reality is essential, but he doesn't hold that view on critics who think art should stand high above reality.

    D: Dostoyevsky believes that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality for the individual experiencing it, but this option doesn't capture his thoughts on the critics who think that art should stand above reality.

    E: This option refers to the opposing view of art serving a societal end. Dostoyevsky believes that art is not restricted to having a utilitarian purpose.

  Option B seems to align with Dostoyevsky's views the most.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's third position includes reality as literature's foundation but extends further into the fantastic.
  His view acknowledges the art standing high above the present and everyday, but also believes in the integration of fantasy and reality.
  He disagrees with the demand for art to serve a particular political view, meaning he doesn't support art for just societal ends.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Thoughts:
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement, which is a technique by which law enforcement agencies can reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement, as mentioned in line 32, is about not following the intent of the legislature.
  It suggests that, though not the central tendency, capricious enforcement does happen but is less likely thanks to legislative oversight.
  Capricious enforcement would involve not adhering to the intent of the legislature when enforcing the law.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the concept of "capricious enforcement" in the context of law enforcement agencies exercising their discretion to not enforce certain laws. It mentions that capricious enforcement does happen but is not the central tendency due to legislative oversight.
  
  The choices given are as follows:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law

  Looking at these choices, "capricious enforcement" would most likely involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law. This can be inferred from the idea that legislative oversight is meant to ensure that law enforcement agencies do not stray too far from the intended regulation.

  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A explains that discretionary enforcement can be applied so that the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without increasing underinclusion. However, capricious enforcement is mentioned as not unknown (or even rare). By elaborating that legislative oversight assures the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced, we could understand that capricious enforcement most likely refers to when the enforcement does not follow the intent of the legislature.

  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thoughts:
  Capricious enforcement refers to law enforcement that is unpredictable, arbitrary, or inconsistent. In Passage A, capricious enforcement would involve not following the intent of the legislature while enforcing the law. Therefore, the correct answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The phrase "capricious enforcement" would imply that law enforcement is done without a clear pattern or objectives and deviates from the intent of the legislature. 

  In passage A, "capricious enforcement" is mentioned as something that is not rare but is not the central tendency due to legislative oversight. 

Answer: E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 5:
Thought:
  "Capricious enforcement" implies an inconsistent or arbitrary enforcement of the law.
  Passage A discusses the idea of enforcement agencies using discretion to not prosecute certain violations.
  This discretion helps reduce the social costs of overinclusion in legal rules.
  However, capricious enforcement deviates from the intended regulation of the legislature.

  Looking at the choices, E: "not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law" seems to fit the description of capricious enforcement most accurately.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses "capricious enforcement" as part of the discussion about the tendency for law enforcement to use discretion when applying overinclusive rules.
  It says that capricious enforcement is not unknown, but it is not the central tendency due to legislative oversight. 
  So, capricious enforcement would involve deviating from the intended regulation or the legislative intent.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement can be understood as an inconsistent or unpredictable way of enforcing the law, not in line with the legislature's intent. 

  Choice A is incorrect as it suggests limited resources as the cause.
  Choice B is incorrect as it suggests enforcement according to the legislature's intent.
  Choice C is incorrect as it emphasizes prioritizing according to damage caused.
  Choice D is incorrect because it implies a misunderstanding of the law's intent.

  The correct answer is Choice E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement as a way to reduce overinclusion. It also states that capricious enforcement is not unknown, mentioning legislative oversight and how it assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation.
  The term "capricious enforcement" suggests a type of enforcement that is arbitrary or inconsistent, which means it would not follow the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes the utility maximization principle being used by legal scholars to reconcile two seemingly opposing perspectives on crime deterrence. The principle serves as a common ground to show that these perspectives share common goals, even though they have different approaches.
  
  We must find a choice that describes a similar scenario where an approach or concept is used to reconcile or bridge two seemingly opposing ideas.

Answer:

Choice E is about setting a tone, which is not reconciling opposing ideas.
Choices A, C, and D involve using examples or evidence from unrelated fields and do not show a reconciliation of opposing views.
Choice B is the best answer as it describes using a law of optics to demonstrate that lines that seemingly diverge are actually parallel. This is similar to how the utility maximization principle is used to show that two seemingly opposing views in crime deterrence can actually complement each other.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to show that the two crime deterrence approaches are complementary.
  This is similar to a situation where different perspectives are reconciled.
  Among the given choices, B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other, is the most similar scenario since it reconciles seemingly different perspectives.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought process:
  Utility maximization principle which reconciles the two positions on crime deterrence.
  The passage discusses legal scholars using this principle to analyze the crime debate.
  We need to find a choice where a principle is utilized in an analysis of a debate or phenomenon in a similar way.
  
  A: A paradox as metaphor is not a principle like utility maximization.
  B: This involves a law of optics, not a principle for comparison or analysis of a debate.
  C: A quotation is not a principle like utility maximization.
  D: Evidence from anthropology is not a principle for analysis.
  E: A short quotation is not a principle to be used for analysis like utility maximization.
  
  None of the choices fit the exact criteria. However, choice B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics is the closest, as it involves using a different field's law to help explain an issue in another context.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle in the passage helps reconcile two different positions regarding crime deterrence. It serves as a common framework to show that both positions can be effective in deterring crime. Thus, we need to find a scenario where something is used to bridge the gap between two different ideas or approaches.
  
  Analyzing the choices:
  A: The astronomer's use of paradox is not bringing two opposing ideas together.
  B: The drawing instructor's use of a law of optics demonstrates a fact related to lines but doesn't reconcile two opposing ideas.
  C: The botanist's use of a quotation is making a point about a topic but not reconciling two ideas.
  D: The judge uses evidence from anthropology, but it doesn't involve bridging a gap between two opposing ideas.
  E: The mediator uses a quotation from a novel to create a common ground and positive environment for conflicting parties.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to show that two seemingly opposing positions in the crime deterrence debate are actually complementary.
  The passage describes the utility maximization theory to show that both positions in the crime deterrence debate have the same overall effect.

The most similar scenario to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate is:

  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to show that the two opposing positions on crime deterrence are not fundamentally in conflict and can be complementary.
  The key aspect of this situation is that an economic principle (utility maximization) is used to resolve and reconcile a debate in a different field (crime deterrence in the legal community).

Similarity analysis:
  A: A paradox from ancient cosmologists is employed to describe a new phenomenon in the field of astronomy. Although the paradox might be able to reconcile aspects within the astronomy field, it doesn't involve principles from different fields.
  B: A law of optics (physics) is used in drawing (art) to demonstrate parallel lines. This choice shows an application of a principle from one field (physics) to help understand a concept in another field (art). It provides a complementary explanation from a different field, just like the utility maximization principle in crime deterrence debate.
  C: A quotation from an Olympic athlete is used to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest. Using an athlete's quote does not provide an overarching or complementary principle that reconciles different positions in botany.
  D: Evidence from anthropology is used to support a legal decision, but it doesn't show how the principle reconciles opposing positions within the field of law.
  E: A quotation from a novel is used to set a tone in a mediation session. The quotation doesn't involve principles from different fields being applied to reconcile differences within a field.

Based on the similarity analysis, the best answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes legal scholars using the utility maximization principle from economics to reconcile two seemingly opposing positions in the crime deterrence debate. They use this economic principle to show that both positions are actually complementary in reducing crimes.

Choice analysis:
  A: This choice talks about using an old paradox to describe a new phenomenon, which is unrelated to reconciling opposing views.
  B: This choice presents using a law from physics to demonstrate a fact, not reconciling opposing positions.
  C: This choice mentions using a quotation from an athlete to make a point but does not involve reconciling opposing views.
  D: This choice involves using anthropology evidence in a legal case, but not in reconciling opposing positions.
  E: This choice talks about using a quotation to create an atmosphere of collegiality and good conduct, indirectly aiming at bringing together differing views.

  Thus, choice E is the most similar to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle to reconcile two positions in the crime deterrence debate.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes how legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to reconcile two seemingly opposing perspectives on crime deterrence.
  The most similar scenario would be one where a concept from one field is used to bring together two seemingly opposing perspectives in another field.
  
  A: An astronomer using a paradox as a metaphor - not bringing together opposing perspectives.
  B: A drawing instructor using a law of optics - combining concepts from different fields, but not resolving opposing perspectives.
  C: A botanist using a quotation from an athlete - using an analogy, but not resolving opposing perspectives.
  D: A judge using evidence from anthropology - combining concepts from different fields, but not resolving opposing perspectives.
  E: A mediator using a quotation from a novel - attempting to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct, possibly reconciling opposing viewpoints.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
- The passage is about the use of the utility maximization principle by legal scholars to reconcile two opposing views on crime deterrence.
- The utility maximization principle is an economic principle.
- The passage discusses how this principle helps in understanding that both deterrence strategies can have the same overall effect.

Let's analyze each choice:

A: This choice involves a phenomenon observed with new technologies, not the reconciliation of two opposing viewpoints using an economic principle.

B: This choice involves the use of a law of optics from physics, but it doesn't involve the reconciliation of opposing viewpoints.

C: This choice uses a quotation from an athlete as a metaphor, but it doesn't connect to an economic principle reconciling two opposing views in a debate.

D: This choice involves a judge using anthropology to support a decision in a legal case, but it doesn't involve the use of an economic principle to show the common ground between two opposing views.

E: This choice involves a mediator setting a tone of collegiality using a well-known novel quotation, but it doesn't involve the use of an economic principle to reconcile two opposing views on crime deterrence.

Considering the analysis above, none of the choices is a good match to the legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.

Unfortunately, the available choices do not accurately reflect the situation presented in the passage, and none of them presents a direct similarity to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. Since I am obligated to select one of the available choices, I will choose the option that is closest, albeit not directly similar, to the passage scenario.

In this case, the closest option is D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. This option involves the use of an external field (anthropology in this case, economics in the passage) to support or improve a legal argument or decision.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle is being used by some legal scholars to show that two apparently opposite positions in the crime deterrence debate can actually work together and complement each other.
  The most similar scenario should involve an example where a concept from another field or a quote is used to reconcile seemingly opposing ideas or viewpoints.

Choices:
  A: A metaphor from ancient cosmologists - Not focused on reconciling opposing ideas.
  B: A law of optics from physics - Demonstrates a fact, not reconciling opposing ideas.
  C: A quotation from an Olympic athlete - Doesn't focus on reconciling opposing viewpoints but makes a point about competition.
  D: Evidence from anthropology - Supports a decision, not reconciling opposing ideas.
  E: A quotation from a novel - Sets a tone, but does not reconcile opposing ideas.

  None of the offered choices seem to closely match the scenario in the passage. However, since a choice must be made, option D is the closest to addressing a debate or controversy. So, I will go with option D.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage tells us that the researchers expected the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  This expectation led them to overlook the evidence of nuclear fission for some time.
  If the researchers did not have particular expectations about the nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to the possibility that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
  Therefore, choice B seems most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage states that researchers did not recognize they were witnessing nuclear fission because they expected the by-products to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. If the researchers did not have particular expectations about the nuclear composition, they might have been more open to the possibility of nuclear fission.

  Therefore, option B: "The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products" is most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The passage mentions that the physicists had the assumption that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
- This assumption hindered the discovery of nuclear fission.
- If the physicists did not have these expectations, they might have discovered it faster. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that one reason the products of the neutron bombardment experiments remained unidentified was the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This expectation limited their ability to see that they had actually achieved nuclear fission because they were not open to the possibility of atoms being split, which produces elements with very different nuclear compositions.

  If the researchers did not have particular expectations about the nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more receptive to the idea that they had achieved nuclear fission, thus reducing the time it took to discover this.

  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that researchers didn't recognize nuclear fission because they were expecting by-products close to uranium in nuclear composition. Their expectations of the products hampered their ability to see the truth of what they were witnessing.
  If the physicists didn't have particular expectations regarding the nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to considering the possibility of nuclear fission.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that the products of the neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because of the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This expectation hampered the researchers' ability to recognize that the atoms were being split.

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: If all physicists were using the same research techniques, it doesn't necessarily mean they would have realized atoms were being split sooner.
  B: If the physicists did not have specific expectations about the nuclear composition, they might have been more open to considering the possibility of atoms being split.
  C: Being unaware of calculations indicating the possibility of atoms being split would not help in realizing that atoms were being split.
  D: More physicists focusing on experimental results would not necessarily lead to the realization that atoms were being split.
  E: Conducting experiments on a different substance wouldn't necessarily lead to the realization that atoms were being split in the case of uranium.

  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in the neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought process:
A: Using the same research techniques does not necessarily reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
B: Without particular expectations regarding the nuclear composition, they might have been more open to recognizing the evidence of nuclear fission.
C: Not being aware of the calculations could hinder the realization of atoms being split, not reduce the time.
D: More physicists focusing on the experiments might help, but it does not address the issue of expectations or recognizing the evidence.
E: Conducting experiments on other substances does not directly contribute to reducing the time to realize atoms were being split in the case of uranium.

Based on the thought process, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that researchers did not recognize the evidence of nuclear fission because they expected the by-products to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This expectation caused them to overlook the possibility that they were splitting uranium atoms.

  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to the possibility that they were splitting uranium atoms. This would have led them to recognize the evidence of nuclear fission sooner.

  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that the products of the experiments remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. This expectation made it difficult for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

  If the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they might have been more open to the possibility that atoms were being split.

  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  It was the expectations regarding the nuclear composition of by-products that delayed the realization of atomic splitting.
  Therefore, reducing those expectations would have reduced the time taken for the realization.

Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or even is unaware of. From passage A's assertions, the one that most clearly exemplifies this idea is the assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author of passage B is calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by attributing an interest (gene proliferation) that the individual exhibiting the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of. 
  Out of the given choices, D: "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" is the assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies this idea since it attributes an underlying, unacknowledged interest (gene propagation) to an action that appears unselfish.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author of passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by attributing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent is not aware of.
  We need to find the assertion in passage A that most clearly exemplifies this idea.

  A: This choice talks about the general perspective of evolutionary psychologists, but does not address the "conspiracy" aspect.
  B: This choice states a problem for evolutionary psychology, but doesn't give an example of attributing hidden motives.
  C: This choice describes altruism, but does not mention the hidden motives or interests behind it.
  D: This choice claims that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that may appear unselfish. This directly exemplifies the "conspiracy theory" aspect because it attributes a hidden interest (proliferation of genes) to the seemingly unselfish action.
  E: This choice provides historical context for humans, but doesn't address the "conspiracy" aspect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author of passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it imputes an interest (propagation of genes) that the agent of the behavior is not aware of or doesn't openly acknowledge. Looking at the assertions from passage A, the one that most clearly exemplifies this idea is when it says "genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish." This assertion explains behavior by attributing it to the hidden interest of propagating genes.
  The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author of passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is unaware of.
  From the passage A options, the statement that most clearly exemplifies this concept is the one that talks about genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author of Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by attributing an interest (proliferation of genes) that the individual is not aware of.
  The assertion from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies this idea is the one that mentions genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, even though the individual may not be aware of this mechanism.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

Thought:
  According to the author of passage B, evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior by attributing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge or is not aware of, such as the proliferation of genes. This is best exemplified by the assertion from passage A that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  In passage B, the author calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. So we need to find a statement from passage A which is explaining an action/behavior as a disguised interest in gene proliferation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage B mentions that evolutionary psychology is a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.
  The choice that most clearly exemplifies this idea would attribute the behavior to the hidden interest of gene propagation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it attributes hidden interests to the subjects of the behavior that they are not aware of (i.e., the proliferation of genes). The assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies this is the one where genes are described as promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, as this suggests a hidden interest/cause behind the behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" appears in the context of as-told-to life histories of Native Americans, which were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  
  The phrase suggests that these written documents involved the collaboration of people from different cultures, where one person (Native American) provided the oral information, and the other person (non-Native American) translated, recorded, and edited the content.

  Therefore, the meaning of the phrase is likely conveyed by a choice that describes a collaboration between different cultures, where one person provides the content and the other person edits or records it.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage refers to autobiographies of Native Americans as potentially being the result of "bicultural composite authorship." In the context of the passage, this seems to suggest that these autobiographies emerge from collaboration between Native American individuals and non-Native American collaborators.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" can be understood as:
  - "bi": two
  - "cultural": belonging to two different cultures
  - "composite": made up of or formed from several parts
  - "authorship": the origin and composition of a piece of work

  In the context of the passage, this specifically refers to written documents that have been "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators." This implies an involvement of people from two distinct cultures in the creation of the document.

  Accordingly, the answer choice D best captures the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship" as used in the passage, since it is written originally by a member of one culture (Native American) but edited and revised by a member of another culture (non-Native American).
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  In the context of the passage, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to as-told-to life histories, meaning those that were "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators." Thus, it involves participation from someone belonging to the culture of Native Americans and someone not from the Native American culture.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is mentioned in the context of as-told-to life histories of Native Americans, which were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  This indicates that the life histories involve the collaboration of two different cultures, with one providing the oral communication and the other documenting and editing it.
  Therefore, the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" aligns with option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5, describing the as-told-to life histories.
  These histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  This means they were a combination of the stories from Native Americans and the work of non-Native American collaborators.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in relation to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  "Bicultural" implies that it involves two different cultures.
  "Composite" suggests that it's a combined effort.
  "Authorship" refers to the creation of the documents.
  The context suggests that these life histories were a result of a collaboration between non-Native American and Native American individuals.
  The most fitting choice is one that describes this collaboration as involving members of different cultures.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The context mentioned "bicultural composite authorship" when referring to "as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators." This means that the works were based on oral communication by Native Americans but recorded and edited by someone from a different culture. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" appears in the context of discussing life histories solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  This suggests that the works are composed of contributions from people of two different cultures (Native American and non-Native American).
  The collaboration involves one culture (non-Native American) translating, recording, and editing the life histories while the content is based on the experiences of the other culture (Native American).
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of authorship that involves different cultures.
- The context discusses how scholars have focused on studies based on as-told-to life histories by non-Native American collaborators, which is considered a "bicultural composite authorship".
- This means that the authorship includes the contributions of both Native American and non-Native American cultures.

Thus, the best answer choice for the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is:

Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: According to the passage, Dunham's work in anthropology differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s in that Dunham

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned to provide evidence for one explanation of the phenomenon of rivalry affecting happiness.

  In Passage B, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned and the author acknowledges the theory about superiority; however, the passage goes on to argue that success, not superiority, is what brings happiness, based on available evidence. 

  The answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
- Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to illustrate the phenomenon of rivalry in the context of happiness and wealth.
- Passage B refers to the Solnick and Hemenway study to argue against the common belief that people care most about one-upmanship. Instead, it claims that earning more makes people happier because they feel successful and have created value.

The answer is:
A: to present a view that will be argued against (Passage A) to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided (Passage B)

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought process:
Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to show how people value relative prosperity and choose to be happier with their position compared to others. This is provided as evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.

Passage B mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to discuss how the urge to demonstrate our superiority is a common explanation, but then argues that the better explanation is that we use material wealth to show our success and the value we create.

So, the pair that describes the use of the study in both passages is:
Passage A: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
Passage B: to present a view that will be argued against

The correct answer is E.

  Passage A mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for the explanation of rivalry and how it affects happiness.
  Passage B mentions the study by Solnick and Hemenway to argue against the idea that rivalry and one-upmanship are the main motivations for happiness and instead presents the idea of feeling successful in creating value as the main reason.

  Conclusion: 
  The correct answer is choice B: to present a view that will be argued against (Passage A) and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon (Passage B).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
- In Passage A, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
- In Passage B, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned to present a view that will be argued against.
- So, the pair that most accurately describes the authors' reasons for mentioning that study is "to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon" and "to present a view that will be argued against."

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:

  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study as a way to demonstrate the phenomenon of rivalry and how it affects people's happiness, showing that people value their relative income position rather than an absolute income level.

  Passage B mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study, but it aims to provide a different explanation for the results, stating that it is not about outperforming others (one-upmanship) but rather about feeling successful and creating value.

  So, the authors of Passage A and Passage B, respectively, use the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to argue against a view, providing an alternative explanation.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study as an example to help demonstrate the phenomenon of rivalry and how people prefer to have a higher relative position in terms of income.

Passage B discusses the Solnick and Hemenway study to show that people are not primarily focused on one-upmanship, but rather on the feeling of being successful, which is tied to relative prosperity.

Therefore, the best answer choice is:
B: to present a view that will be argued against, and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  In passage A, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned to provide evidence for the role of rivalry in happiness.
  In passage B, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned to challenge the common belief of wanting to have more than others.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A: The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to provide an example of how people choose a lower overall income if it means having a higher relative income, which touches upon the phenomenon of rivalry and happiness.
  Passage B: The study is brought up to argue that it is not one-upmanship that makes people happier with higher income; instead, it is the feeling of success and the creation of value.

So, the Solnick and Hemenway study is used:
  A (Passage A): to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  B (Passage B): to present a view that will be argued against

Therefore, the correct answer is:
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54) is used to illustrate the motivation behind entrepreneurs and investors who must expand their market to maximize their financial success. This expansion leads to the diffusion of benefits across society, which is the central thesis of the passage.

  The passage emphasizes that market competition, driven by the need to maximize financial success, results in greater accessibility of technology and benefits to larger parts of the population.

  Therefore, the primary function of this reference is to serve as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how technological developments have served as a democratizing force, narrowing the gap in benefits experienced by different groups of people. Financial success is mentioned in the context of entrepreneurs and investors being unable to maximize it without expanding their market and making technologies accessible to a larger share of the population (lines 52-54). This point is presented to show that the market system's competition drives prices down, therefore spreading access to new technology across society.

  Analyzing the given choices:

  A: The reference to financial success doesn't form part of the author's summary of the benefits of technological developments but instead supports a broader point about the market system driving prices down.
  
  B: The reference to financial success is not a logical conclusion from the data on technological development's social consequences; it's a part of the explanation for how the market system spreads access to technology.
  
  C: The reference is not a speculative hypothesis; it's an argument in support of the general tendency of the market system to spread access to new technology.
  
  D: The reference serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. This choice aligns with the role of the financial success discussion within the passage.
  
  E: The reference to financial success doesn't form a concession complicating the author's argument; it supports the author's argument about the market system's role in spreading benefits.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise
  C: concerned that research results supporting it may omit crucial anecdotal evidence indicating pitfalls in its use

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that patent litigation is expensive and usually initiated to protect a market position.
  It adds that judges tend to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the critique of the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans in psychology. It explains how the subtractive method, which measures the difference in oxygen use between a control condition and a cognitive task, can give a false impression of functional localization. Therefore, it's important to consider that the whole brain is active during both conditions, and the modular theory of mind might not be as accurate as it seems.

Answer:
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains how the subtractive method, used in functional magnetic resonance imaging, creates brain scans with well-defined, "lit up" areas as a result of measuring the differential rate of oxygen use. It states that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions but the subtraction method gives the impression of functional localization. This supports the statement that during the performance of cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the subtractive method in brain scans. It explains that the modular theory of mind suggests that mental activities can be separated into different modules located in specific brain regions. However, this idea is not universally accepted, and some argue that mental processes are properties of more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain. The author explains that brain scans may create a false impression of functional localization due to the subtractive method.

The author does not argue that most cognition depends on independent modules, making choice A incorrect. Also, the passage does not comment about the modular theory of mind assuming that regions of the brain have a rate of oxygen use close to zero when not engaged in a specific task, as choice B posits. Choice D talks about baseline measurements but does not strongly support the passage. Lastly, choice E discusses anger but is not strongly supported by the passage.

Choice C, on the other hand, is supported by the passage. It says that during some cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active have a higher rate of oxygen use than that of the rest of the brain. This idea is consistent with the subtractive method explanation provided in the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the modular theory of mind and how the subtractive method in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works. The subtractive method measures the rate of oxygen use and compares the difference between the baseline measurement (control condition) and on-task measurement. It states that FMRI brain scans give a false impression of neat functional localization, as it subtracts out the distributed brain functions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage discusses the limitations of the modular theory of mind and explains how FMRI brain scans produce the results they do. The passage states that entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method is used to highlight specific parts that are more active during a cognitive task.

Choice C mentions how during cognitive tasks, those areas in the brain being used more are shown to have a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain. This aligns with the information presented in the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that the FMRI, used in the subtractive method, shows the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain during cognitive tasks. The passage also explains that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions, but the subtractive method only shows the difference in oxygen use, giving an impression of functional localization. Based on this information:

Choice A: This statement is not supported by the passage.
Choice B: The passage does not discuss the rate of oxygen use in the brain regarding the modular theory of mind.
Choice C: The passage supports this statement by explaining that the FMRI shows differential rates of oxygen use and metabolic activity during cognitive tasks.
Choice D: The passage does not provide specific information about the baseline measurements of oxygen use in certain regions of the brain.
Choice E: The passage does not discuss brain scan results when a subject experiences anger.

The statement most strongly supported by the passage is:
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of the subtractive method in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), which can create a false impression of functional localization in the brain. The passage criticizes the modular theory of mind and states that the entire brain is active in both conditions (baseline and cognitive tasks).

Answer: 
  Choice C best aligns with the content of the passage, discussing the areas of the brain that are more metabolically active during cognitive tasks.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind, which depends on the idea that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, and these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. However, it also mentions the critique by psychologist William Uttal, who argues that mental processes might not be decomposable into independent modules. The passage explains that brain scans using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) show well-defined areas that light up in response to various cognitive tasks because they depict the differential rate of oxygen use. The entire brain is active in both the baseline and on-task measurements, but the subtraction method gives a false impression of functional localization.

The statement most strongly supported by the passage is:

C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans, specifically FMRI, in psychology. The method involves subtracting the baseline measurement of oxygen use from the on-task measurement and creates the impression of functional localization and distinct modules in the brain. However, this subtractive method does not reflect the distributed brain functions (refer to the last three lines of the passage). 

  Going through the choices provided:
  A - The passage raises concerns about the modular theory, so this choice is not supported.
  B - The passage does not mention the oxygen use rate being close to zero.
  C - The passage explains that FMRI shows higher metabolic activity in specific areas, which is due to the subtractive process.
  D - The passage mentions baseline measurements but doesn't say that certain regions have high activity at all times.
  E - The passage does not specifically mention experiencing anger in relation to brain scans.

  The choice that is most supported by the passage is C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and how it relies on the assumption that the mind can be separated into distinct modules with specific brain regions. It also states that subtractive method, used in neuroimaging, can create a false impression of functional localization. It explains that the subtractive method works by taking two measurements of oxygen use (baseline and during a cognitive task) and subtracting the baseline measurement to find the difference.

The passage does not support A since it's arguing against distinct cognitive modules.
The passage does not support B as it doesn't discuss the rate of oxygen use being close to zero.
The passage does support C since it explains that differential brain scans show the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks.
The passage does not support D as it doesn't specifically mention that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
The passage does not support E as it doesn't mention how anger specifically affects brain scans.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the similarities between painting and perfumes, and how both arts create sensations and evoke memories. This information can be linked to choice A. The passage does not provide enough support for the other choices.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the comparison between visual arts like oil paintings and the art of creating perfumes, mentioning that both involve the combination of elements to evoke memories and experiences. It highlights that perfumers are in the same business as visual artists in creating an illusion of life or a memory of a long-forgotten experience.

  Analyzing the choices:
  A: This statement is supported by the passage, as it mentions that both painters and perfumers work on evoking memories and experiences in their audience.
  B: The passage describes this concept only for perfumes, and not for art in general.
  C: The passage doesn't claim that any work of art created for commercial success will inevitably fail.
  D: The passage doesn't say that the best works of art improve with age but it does mention the tendency in oil paintings to change its colors.
  E: The passage doesn't assert that some forms of art are superior to others but encourages the recognition of perfumes as art.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarities between paintings and perfumes, and how perfumes as art are often undervalued. The author mentions that perfumers, like other artists, can create an imaginary world that evokes memories of the past. Thus, the statement with the most support from the passage is:

A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarities between perfume creation and other forms of art, and elaborates on how perfumes can evoke memories and experiences just like visual or auditory art forms. The passage suggests that brilliant perfumers can create an imaginary world that can be as powerful and intimate as that of great composers or painters.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage compares perfume creation to other forms of art such as painting. It mentions that in both these forms of art, different sensations are evoked, triggering memories or experiences. This supports the statement about an aesthetic experience through memories evoked by a work of art.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thoughts: 
- The passage compares perfume to other forms of art, mentioning that both painters and perfumers use combinations of elements to create aesthetic experiences.
- It mentions that a brilliant perfumer can create an imaginary world by calling on memories and experiences, similar to a painter on canvas.
- There is a critique on commercialization affecting the quality of perfumes; however, it does not say that commercial success always leads to failure in art.
- The passage does not claim that any form of art is superior to others or that the best works of art improve with age.

Conclusion: The passage provides the most support for statement A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes the similarities between painting and perfumery. It mentions that both painters and perfumers carefully combine natural and synthetic elements to create an experience.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.
  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility

Thought:
  Passage A is focused on the idea that people's choices are determined by their brain activity, and it suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than retribution. The main concepts in passage A are rationality, causality, brain operations, emotional centers, moral choice, self-delusion, and retribution.

  Passage B introduces the concepts of free will, determinism, and the distinction between free and constrained actions. It argues that in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely if their actions are not constrained, even though they may be determined. The concepts in passage B include determinism, causality, free actions, constrained actions, mental disorders, and the source of the cause.

  When comparing the concepts in both passages, mental disorder, free choice, causality, and moral responsibility are present in both. Self-delusion is mentioned in passage A but not in passage B.

  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is self-delusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Both passages discuss different aspects of the relationship between the brain, free will, and the concept of determinism. We need to find a concept that is present in Passage B but not in Passage A.
  
  A: Mental disorder - This is mentioned in both Passage A (the example of totally rational people whose strings are pulled by something beyond their control) and Passage B (as constrained actions).
  B: Free choice - This is more central to Passage B (it is mentioned in the context of "free actions"), but it is also addressed in Passage A (the idea that people believe they are making free and rational moral choices).
  C: Causality - This is present in both Passage A (behavior caused by brain operations; brain scans showing choices correlating with specific brain activity) and Passage B (the physical brain causing behavior; deterministic causal events).
  D: Self-delusion - This is mentioned in Passage A (people who believe they are making a free choice may be deluding themselves). It is not present in Passage B.
  E: Moral responsibility - This is present in both Passage A (the justification of punishment having to do with the individual's moral acts) and Passage B (the distinction between free actions and constrained actions being based on sources).

Conclusion:
  The concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A is "D: self-delusion".

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Analyzing Passage A and Passage B, we can observe the following:

  - Mental disorder: Mentioned in Passage B but not found in Passage A.
  - Free choice: Mentioned in both passages.
  - Causality: Mentioned in both passages.
  - Self-delusion: Mentioned in Passage A but not found in Passage B.
  - Moral responsibility: Found in both passages as a concept related to free will and determinism.

  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is the mental disorder. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought process:
- Passage A talks mainly about brain activity and its influence on the criminal-justice system.
- Passage B introduces the concept of "soft determinism" and the difference between free actions and constrained actions.
- Comparing the two passages, only Choice D: self-delusion is not discussed in Passage B.
- Therefore, the answer is D: self-delusion.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses free and rational moral choice, brain scans, and deterrence of future harms. It does not mention determinism, soft determinism, or Ayer's philosophy.

  Passage B discusses soft determinism, Ayer's ideas, and differentiates between free actions and constrained actions. It mentions mental disorders and their impact on actions.

  A: mental disorder - Both passages mention mental disorders.
  B: free choice - Passage A talks about free and rational moral choice, so it does appear in both.
  C: causality - Both discuss causality in some form.
  D: self-delusion - Passage A does mention self-delusion with individuals thinking they made a choice, but it isn't mentioned in Passage B.
  E: moral responsibility - Both passages mention moral responsibility in some form.

Conclusion: Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
- Here is the main idea of each passage:
    Passage A: All behavior is caused by brain operations; free and rational moral choices can be affected by emotional centers in the brain; law should focus on deterring future harms.
    Passage B: The concept of free will can coexist with determinism; Free actions are caused by internal sources, and constrained actions are caused by external sources; actions are free as long as they are not constrained.

- Let's analyze each choice and see if it plays a role in Passage B but not Passage A:
  A: Mental disorder - Mentioned in Passage B (kleptomania), but also mentioned in Passage A (causing people to lose control of their actions)
  B: Free choice - Discussed in Passage B (free actions caused by internal sources), not explicitly mentioned in Passage A.
  C: Causality - Present in both passages, as it discusses determinism and brain operations causing behavior.
  D: Self-delusion - Mentioned in Passage A (people may be deluding themselves when making choices)
  E: Moral responsibility - Mentioned in Passage A (bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts)

From the analysis, option B: free choice plays a role in Passage B but not in Passage A.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thoughts:
  - In Passage A, mental disorder, free choice, causality, self-delusion, and moral responsibility are all present in the text.
  - Passage B discusses mental disorder, causality, and free choice.
  - The unique concept in Passage B, which is not in Passage A, is the distinction between free actions and constrained actions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Let's review the concepts in both passages.

  Passage A:
    - Neuroscience and behavior
    - Criminal justice system
    - Retribution idea
    - Deterrence
    - Free and rational moral choice
    - Emotions in brain
    - Self-delusion (mentioned)
    - Mental disorder (implicitly mentioned)

  Passage B:
    - Neuroscience, deterministic view, and human action
    - Free will and determinism
    - Soft determinism (Ayer's theory)
    - Free actions vs. constrained actions
    - Internal vs. external sources
    - Mental disorder (mentioned)
    - Free choice (discussed in Ayer's theory)

  Based on the reviews, we can eliminate the concepts present in both passages A and B:
    - Mental disorder (A)

    The remaining choices are:
      B: free choice
      C: causality
      D: self-delusion
      E: moral responsibility

The concept of self-delusion is present in Passage A but not in Passage B. The concept of moral responsibility is not mentioned in either passage directly. So, the correct answer is the concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B, but not in that of Passage A, which is free choice.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought process:
- Passage A discusses neuroscience, rationality, free choice, the criminal-justice system, retribution, and delusion. 
- Passage B discusses determinism, free will, soft determinism, free actions, constrained actions, mental disorder, and Ayer's theory.

Concepts in passage B but not passage A:
A: Mental disorder is mentioned in both passages.
B: Free choice - This concept can be related to the idea of free will which is present in passage B, but passage A is also related to choices too in terms of rational moral choice. So, not unique to passage B.
C: Causality - This concept is present in both passages as both talk about the brain causing behavior.
D: Self-delusion - This is mentioned in passage A (as delusion) but not in passage B.
E: Moral responsibility - This concept seems to be unique to passage B as passage A focuses more on retribution and rationality.

The concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is:
E: Moral responsibility.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses brain functions, rationality, and the impact of neuroscience on the criminal justice system. It suggests abandoning the idea of retribution and focuses on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of "soft determinism" and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, even in a deterministic world.

  From the list of choices, we analyze which concept plays a role in passage B but not in passage A:

  A: Mental disorder - It is mentioned in both passages.
  B: Free choice - Mentioned in both passages as a point of discussion.
  C: Causality - Inferred or implied both in A (behavior caused by brain operations) and B (causally necessitated by events).
  D: Self-delusion - Mentioned in passage A (people deluding themselves about making a free and rational choice). It is not mentioned in passage B.
  E: Moral responsibility - It is implied in both passages as a factor connected to human actions and behaviors.

  Only choice D: self-delusion is used in passage A but not used in passage B.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split
  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes how the physics community during the 1930s did not initially recognize nuclear fission even though there was evidence. It mentions that they had "increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing." The physics community was not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission happening in their experiments. The passage also indicates that scientists during the 1930s recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that during the 1930s, physicists were conducting experiments on neutron bombardment of uranium, without recognizing that they were witnessing nuclear fission. It does not mention that they neglected earlier theoretical developments, reevaluated calculations about splitting atoms, showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split, or recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances specifically. However, it does mention that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were not identified until late in the 1930s when Lise Meitner finally recognized the significance of the data. Also, it is mentioned that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.

  The answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium until Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that earlier theoretical developments were made about the possibility of breaking atoms apart, but researchers were not receptive to this idea during the neutron-bombardment experiments (indicating that they neglected earlier theoretical developments). Therefore, the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the scientific discovery of nuclear fission and how the physics community did not immediately recognize the significance of the data or the possibility of splitting atoms. This is evident by the text: "Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context."

Answer choices analysis:
  A: The passage indicates that the physics community did not directly build on earlier theoretical developments (true).
  B: The passage does not mention a reevaluation of calculations indicating that atoms could be split (false).
  C: The passage mentions that the by-products could not be identified for various reasons, including the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition (partially true).
  D: The passage does not specify whether uranium atoms were the easiest to split (false).
  E: The passage acknowledges the dangers of working with radioactive materials as one of the reasons for the difficulty in identifying the by-products (true).

Given that the passage directly supports options A and E, and C is only partially true, the best answer is a combination of A and E. Since only one answer can be selected, I will choose the answer that seems to be more central to the discussion of the physics community's shortcomings in recognizing their findings.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
- The passage talks about the advancements, experiments, and discoveries in the field of physics during the 1930s, specifically nuclear fission.
- It states that some theoretical physicists had earlier produced calculations that atoms could be split, but researchers were not receptive to this possibility.
- Multiple experiments led to the identification of by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, although the precise identification was hampered by various factors like minute quantities produced and dangers of working with radioactive substances.
- The passage mentions that Lise Meitner finally recognized the significance of data related to splitting uranium atoms, and the term "nuclear fission" was coined.

Matching the answer choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments. - This is true; researchers were not receptive to the earlier calculations that atoms could be split. They didn't build on these calculations throughout the experiments. Therefore, this is a possible answer.
  B: It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split - This isn't mentioned in the passage. Incorrect.
  C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium - This is false; the by-products were identified, but the researchers didn't recognize the implications of their findings in nuclear fission. Incorrect.
  D: It showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split - This comparison isn't mentioned in the passage. Incorrect.
  E: It recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances - It's mentioned that the precise identification of by-products was hampered by the dangers of working with radioactive substances. This means the physics community recognized the dangers. This is a possible answer.

Final thought: Both A and E are true, but considering the key point of the passage, A is most relevant to the overall topic. Answer A focuses on the physics community's relationship to theoretical developments and their understanding of nuclear fission, which is the main subject of the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:

  C: By-products remained unidentified for some time, not never - False.
  D: No mention that uranium atoms were easiest to split - False.
  E: The passage mentions the dangers of working with radioactive substances - True.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how the physics community in the 1930s overlooked the possibility of nuclear fission even when there was evidence.
  In the 1930s, theoretical physicists predicted that atoms could break apart, but researchers were not receptive to this idea.
  The by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because of the challenges associated with their detection and the expectation that they would be elements close to uranium.
  The passage does not mention that the community specifically showed uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
  The passage states that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, indicating that the physics community recognized the dangers.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. However, the experiments in the 1930s were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility. Also, they failed to recognize that they were witnessing nuclear fission as they compiled evidence. This shows that the physics community during the 1930s neglected earlier theoretical developments.

  The answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes how scientists in the 1930s were experimenting with neutron bombardment of uranium but did not immediately recognize the significance of their results (nuclear fission). It also mentions that theoretical physicists had produced calculations about breaking atoms apart earlier, and some researchers were working on similar experiments, but they were not receptive to the possibility of achieving nuclear fission in the context of neutron bombardment experiments. The passage also mentions the difficulties in identifying the products of these experiments due to the small quantities involved and the danger of working with radioactive materials.

  Considering the situation described in the 1930s physics community:

  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments - This statement seems accurate to some extent, since scientists were not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission during their neutron bombardment experiments.
  B: It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split - Not mentioned in the passage.
  C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium - Not true, as it is mentioned that several radioactive substances were produced and identified during these experiments.
  D: It showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split - Not mentioned in the passage.
  E: It recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances - Mentioned in the passage as one of the reasons for the difficulty in identifying the products of the experiments.

  The most accurate statement seems to be A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage states that even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split. However, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving atomic splitting, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. The physics community in the 1930s was able to identify by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium but did not recognize the significance of these results. The passage also mentions the dangers of working with radioactive materials.

  The correct answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  Other choices:

When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence mentioned in line 62 refers to the data that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. This evidence was present for some time before Lise Meitner made the right conceptual link.
  The experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939 provided increasing evidence that nuclear fission had occurred (as mentioned earlier in the passage).

  So, the relevant evidence is related to the experiments done by the physics community during that period.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The evidence is described as something that had been present for some time but lacking the right conceptual link. It refers to the findings made by various scientists that, when considered, would lead to understanding nuclear fission.

  A: Completely possible because results of earlier experiments did not recognize nuclear fission.
  B: Meitner's 1938 experiments are only a part of the evidence, not the complete relevant evidence.
  C: Hahn's evidence of barium is again only a part of the evidence, not the complete relevant evidence.
  D: This fact is an observation derived from Hahn's findings but does not encompass the complete relevant evidence.
  E: This is a description of the situation, not the evidence that was present.

  Among the given choices, A seems most comprehensive and matches the description.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence is mentioned in the last sentence of the passage. It is related to the discovery of nuclear fission, which had been overlooked for a long time.
  The author indicates that the evidence had been present, lacking the right conceptual link.
  This suggests that the relevant evidence is related to the experiments that were already conducted but were not properly linked to the concept of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link. This indicates that the evidence was from earlier experiments and not just from Meitner's 1938 experiments. Since the passage talks about scientists compiling evidence between 1934 and 1939, the relevant evidence should be related to this time frame and experiments conducted during this period.

  So, choice A, which refers to experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted between 1934 and 1939, is the most likely answer.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that when scientists rushed to corroborate the findings of nuclear fission, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, but it was lacking the right conceptual link. This implies that the evidence was available in the results of previous experiments conducted between 1934 and 1939.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how new scientific understanding was built on existing experiments and data without recognizing the results of nuclear fission. The "relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that was already gathered but wasn't properly understood or linked to the concept of nuclear fission.
  Let's analyze the given choices:

  A: This choice refers to the experiments conducted between 1934 and 1939, which seems relevant to the evidence mentioned in the passage.
  
  B: This choice only refers to Meitner's experiments in 1938, which is too specific to represent the "relevant evidence" for the whole scientific community.
  
  C: This choice focuses on Hahn's discovery of barium, which is part of the evidence but not all of it.
  
  D: This choice talks about a specific fact related to protons and neutrons in the nuclei, which is again part of the evidence but not the whole picture.
  
  E: This choice talks about the unidentified products, but it doesn't encompass the full range of evidence mentioned in the passage.

  Among the given choices, choice A best represents the whole evidence mentioned in the passage.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought process:
- The "relevant evidence" is described as having been present for some time, but lacking the right conceptual link.
- Choice A refers to the results of neutron bombardment experiments between 1934 and 1939, which would have provided evidence that fission was occurring, but the scientists had not made the connection yet. This choice seems to fit the description of "relevant evidence."
- The other choices are specific pieces of information or results, but do not serve to represent the general body of evidence leading to the discovery of nuclear fission.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:

Thought:
The author states that "When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time", which is referring to the evidence that uranium atoms had been split in the experiments. 

Choice A mentions the "results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939". These experiments led to the eventual discovery of nuclear fission and had evidence supporting the breakthrough, so this choice seems most relevant to the context. 

The other choices (B, C, D, and E) discuss specific results or observations during various experiments, but they do not encompass the broader range of evidence that had been accumulated during the experiments.

Considering the context and the choices given, choice A seems to best represent what the author means by "the relevant evidence".

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence mentioned in line 62 refers to information that was finally recognized by Meitner in the context of nuclear fission. Following the context of the passage, it is clear that the author means that the evidence had been there all along but was not correctly understood.

  A: The results of experiments conducted between 1934 and 1939 provide the background of neutron bombardment of uranium and contain the evidence in question.
  B: Meitner's experiments were relevant, but they were not the only source of evidence.
  C: Hahn's clear chemical evidence of barium production is significant but doesn't represent the whole picture of the evidence.
  D: The sum of the number of protons and neutrons is a significant fact but doesn't cover the entirety of the evidence.
  E: The fact that radioactive products went unidentified is important, but it refers to a consequence of not recognizing the evidence.

  Based on the analysis above, choice A encompasses the results gathered by the scientific community between 1934 and 1939, which is what the author refers to as "the relevant evidence."

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The "relevant evidence" refers to the information that was required to understand that nuclear fission had been happening in the experiments conducted between 1934 and 1939.
- The passage states that the evidence had been present for some time, but the understanding that uranium atoms were being split was missing.
- The author mentions that "the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms," which Meitner finally recognized.
- Therefore, the "relevant evidence" is the results of the experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and as having an inner sweetness, with a deliberate naïveté and faith in reconciliation. We need to find a statement that challenges this characterization.

  A: Attending exhibitions does not challenge the characterization of his work.
  B: Praising an atypical painting doesn't challenge his overall view of abstract expressionism or his own work.
  C: Praising an early abstract expressionist's emotional painting is consistent with the claim that he was rebelling against later, less powerful abstract expressionism.

  E: Criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion would not challenge the author's characterization, as it implies Lichtenstein sought more emotion in art.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as an artist who rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and aimed for reconciling parody with true feeling through his work. To challenge this characterization, a statement should indicate a significant deviation from this portrayal.
  
  - A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions does not contradict the author's characterization.
  - B: Acknowledging an atypical emotional piece within abstract expressionism does not negate Lichtenstein's general rebellion against the movement.
  - C: Praising an early abstract expressionist does not conflict with Lichtenstein's rebellion against the fading emotional power of later abstract expressionism.
  - D: Criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings would contradict believing in the reconciliation between parody and true feeling.
  - E: Criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion aligns with the author's characterization of Lichtenstein valuing true feeling.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The author characterizes Lichtenstein as having a deliberate naïveté and an inner sweetness, rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and the excess of sophistication. To challenge this characterization, we need to find an option that shows Lichtenstein either embracing the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism or dismissing the emotional aspects of pop art.

A: This option shows that Lichtenstein was interested and attended exhibitions, but it does not directly challenge the author's characterization of his work.
B: Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for an emotional painting does not challenge the author's characterization since the author emphasizes Lichtenstein's rebellion against the fading emotional power, not against any emotional paintings in general.
C: This option does not challenge the author's characterization, as Lichtenstein could still hold a sense of nostalgia and sweetness while appreciating early abstract expressionist work for its emotional qualities.
D: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings would directly challenge the author's characterization of him being against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and being in favor of portraying emotions in his work.

Therefore, the best option is:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author's characterization of Lichtenstein is that he rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and displayed an impulse toward realism through his comic-art style, showing a deliberate naivete instead of a jaded cynicism. The choice that would most challenge this characterization should contrast with this view of Lichtenstein.

  A: Attending exhibitions doesn't challenge the author's characterization.
  B: Praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for an emotional painting doesn't directly challenge his stance about his own work.
  C: Praising an early abstract expressionist for emotional paintings doesn't challenge his views about his own work or the second generation of abstract expressionists.
  D: Criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings challenges the view that Lichtenstein sought to rebel against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, suggesting he may not have wanted more emotion in the art world.
  E: Criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion does not challenge his stance on the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism or his own work.

  The most challenging choice to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein is D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as someone who rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and aimed to depict contemporary life through the use of comic art conventions. The author also mentions that Lichtenstein's work exuded a deliberate naivete in response to the excess of sophistication observed in both abstract expressionists and some pop artists. Therefore, we need to find an option that challenges this characterization of Lichtenstein.

  A: This option would not challenge the author's characterization since attending exhibitions does not contradict the author's description of Lichtenstein.
  B: Praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for an atypically emotional painting does not challenge the author's characterization since it does not contradict Lichtenstein's rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  C: Praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings could align with the author's characterization because the author acknowledges that pop art was rebelling against the second generation of abstract expressionists, not the powerful early works.
  D: Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings would challenge the author's characterization since it contradicts the idea of Lichtenstein wanting to bring emotional connection back to contemporary painting.
  E: Criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion would not challenge the author's characterization since it aligns with the idea of Lichtenstein's rebellion against the lack of emotional power in contemporary art.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as challenging the emotional power of abstract expressionism and the sophistication in contemporary art with a deliberate naivete and a focus on contemporary life and popular culture.

Choices analysis:
  A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions does not challenge the author's characterization.
  B: This implies that Lichtenstein appreciated the emotional aspect in abstract expressionism, challenging the author's characterization.
  C: This statement shows that Lichtenstein appreciated the emotional aspects of abstract expressionism, but it doesn't necessarily contradict the author's characterization as it refers to early abstract expressionists.
  D: This does not challenge the author's characterization as it doesn't suggest Lichtenstein appreciated the emotional or sophistication in art.
  E: This statement might show Lichtenstein's preference for emotions in paintings, but it does not directly challenge the author's characterization of his opposition to the sophistication of contemporary art.

From the analysis, the statement that would most challenge the author's characterization is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author's characterization of Lichtenstein describes his work as a rebellion against abstract expressionism, reflecting contemporary life with a deliberate naivete and nostalgia, achieving reconciliation between different artistic genres. To challenge this characterization, evidence should counter Lichtenstein's intentions or views described by the author.
  
  A: Lichtenstein attending exhibitions does not necessarily challenge the author's characterization.
  B: Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for an emotional painting does not challenge the author's characterization but shows his appreciation for emotion.

The answer is D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author characterized Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and a response to the excess of sophistication in other art forms. The author also claimed that Lichtenstein's work conveyed an inner sweetness and showed faith in the reconciliation between parody and true feeling. The statement that would challenge this characterization would likely show Lichtenstein supporting the abstract expressionist movement or criticizing the emotional depth in his own pop art genre.

  A: Attending exhibitions does not challenge the author's characterization.
  B: Praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for emotional painting contradicts the author's claim that Lichtenstein's work was meant to be a response to the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  C: Praising an early abstract expressionist doesn't challenge the characterization since the author acknowledges the power of early abstract expressionist work.
  D: Criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings doesn't challenge the author's characterization since the problem he pointed out with abstract expressionism was the lack of emotional power in the later generation of the artists.
  E: Criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion supports the author's characterization that Lichtenstein's work attempts to convey true feelings.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author characterizes Lichtenstein as an artist who rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and aimed to depict contemporary life realistically using comic-art conventions. The author also mentions that Lichtenstein's work exuded a deliberate naivete and inner sweetness, rather than cynicism about consumer culture. Therefore, any statement that contradicts or challenges this characterization would be the correct answer.

Choices:
A: Attending exhibitions doesn't challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
B: Praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting could suggest a different perspective but doesn't directly challenge the author's characterization.
C: Praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings doesn't challenge the author's characterization, as the author acknowledges the powerful early work of abstract expressionists.
D: Criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein because it suggests that Lichtenstein did not appreciate emotional aspects in art, which contrasts with the author's description of inner sweetness in Lichtenstein's work.

The strongest challenge to the author's characterization would be choice D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and as a painter who aims to depict contemporary life with a deliberate naivete and reconciling cartoons with fine art. To challenge this characterization, we would need a statement that contradicts Lichtenstein's attitude towards abstract expressionism or his approach to his own art.

  A: Attending exhibitions does not challenge the author's characterization.
  B: If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist, it would contradict the idea of him rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  C: Praising early abstract expressionists does not challenge the characterization since he was rebelling against the second generation.
  D: Criticizing another pop artist for producing emotional paintings does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's rebellion against abstract expressionism.
  E: Criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's rebellion and his reconciling approach.

  Therefore, the answer that would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein is B: Lichtenstein praising a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought:
Passage A argues that trading based on unique knowledge (insider information) is part of a functioning stock market and helps ensure accurate pricing. It emphasizes that using information/results from analysis is legitimate.
Passage B argues for transparency in the stock market to maintain investor confidence and emphasizes the importance of equal access to information and equal opportunity to profit.

Let's analyze the choices:

A: It prohibits trading based on information not shared by everyone - this goes against Passage A and aligns with Passage B.
B: Permits trading based on analysis and prohibits trading based on one's position in the company - this seems to align with Passage A.
C: Prohibits trading that undermines investor confidence - this goes against Passage A and aligns with Passage B.
D: Legalizes selling based on inside information, but prohibits buying based on it - this is not in line with either passage completely.
E: Legalizes trading based on inside information unless acquired illegally - this aligns with Passage A but goes against Passage B.

The answer is B: A law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
Author A takes a position that insider-trading law should allow for actions based on accurate information about changing circumstances to reflect stock prices more accurately; 
Author B argues for maintaining transparency in the stock market and preventing insider trading due to unfair advantage it creates.

A: The law disallows trading based on any exclusive information - this aligns with passage B's position.
B: Permits trading based on analysis of stock but prohibits trading based on inside information - aligns more with passage B's position.
C: This aligns with passage B's position, as it focuses on investors' confidence.
D: The law allows selling based on insider information but not buying - doesn't align perfectly with either passage.
E: Legalizes trading based on inside information if not acquired unlawfully - this aligns more with passage A's position, allowing information to affect stock prices as long as it's acquired legally.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that trading based on inside information can be beneficial and even help stock markets function better.
  Passage B argues that the stock market should be transparent, and everyone should have equal access to information, which does not support insider trading.

  A: This choice would align with the author of passage B but not passage A.
  B: This choice would partially align with the author of passage A (analyzing a stock), but it still prohibits some forms of insider trading, so it does not completely align with passage A.
  C: This choice would align with the author of passage B but not passage A.
  D: This choice might partially align with the author of passage A (reflecting dropping price in stock market), but it still prohibits some forms of insider trading, so it does not completely align with passage A.
  E: This choice aligns with the author of passage A, allowing trading based on inside information (unless acquired by theft or other unlawful means). This would not align with the author of passage B, as it still allows insider trading.

  Since we are looking for a choice that conforms closely to the position of the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B, choice E is the most appropriate.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
- Passage A argues that trading on private knowledge helps make the stock market more efficient and doesn't see a significant problem with it.
- Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency and equal access to information in the stock market, arguing that insider trading compromises the market.

- Choice A seems to align with Passage B's view on transparency and equal access to information, so it doesn't fit Passage A's position.
- Choice B could align with Passage A, allowing specific information gained from analysis, but it still restricts trading based on one's position within a company and may not be exactly what Passage A argues.
- Choice C aligns with the concerns of Passage B, which emphasizes investor confidence, so it doesn't fit Passage A's position.
- Choice D seems like a compromise but doesn't capture the essence of Passage A's argument for trading based on inside knowledge broadly.
- Choice E seems to most accurately reflect Passage A's position, allowing trading based on inside information as long as it is not acquired unlawfully, while Passage B would likely be against legalizing insider trading.

Answer: The choice that conforms most closely to the position of Passage A but not Passage B is "E". 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that trading based on non-public information can help improve the stock market by spreading information faster and ensuring accurate stock prices. It does not consider the potential harm to investor confidence.
  Passage B stresses the importance of transparency and fairness in the stock market and argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and compromises the market.

  Choice A aligns more with Passage B's position, as it emphasizes not allowing trading based on non-public or unequal information.
  Choice B is closer to Passage A's position, as it allows taking advantage of knowledge gained from analysis but prohibits trading based on inside information from one's company position.
  Choice C aligns more with Passage B, which focuses on investor confidence.
  Choice D is inconsistent with both passages as it considers only one aspect of insider information.
  Choice E is more closely aligned with Passage A since it allows trading based on inside information, provided it's not acquired unlawfully.

  The best choice is E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:

Passage A: Argues that trading based on inside information helps stock prices reflect accurate assessment of a company's value and is good for the market.
Passage B: Argues that a transparent market is essential, and insider-trading unfairly compromises the market, undermining investor confidence.

We need to find a law that conforms to the position of passage A, but not passage B.

A: This choice agrees with Passage B and not with A, so it's not the correct answer.
B: This choice strikes a balance between the needs of both passages, so it's not the correct answer.
C: This choice agrees with Passage B and not with A, so it's not the correct answer.
D: This choice seems complex but doesn't line up with the positions of either passage, so it's not the correct answer.
E: This choice agrees with Passage A and does not enforce transparency as Passage B suggests, so it seems like the correct answer.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that trading based on knowledge and information is part of the functioning stock market and helps stock prices reflect accurate assessment of information.
  Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency in the stock market and argues against insider-trading situations, which give some people an unfair advantage.

  Comparing the available choices with the positions of each passage:

  A - Does not fit Passage A, but fits Passage B's emphasis on transparency.
  B - Fits Passage A's argument on knowledge-based trading, but restricts trading based on one's position, which does not fit Passage B's position against insider-trading.
  C - Does not fit either Passage A's emphasis on knowledge or Passage B's call for transparency.
  D - Partially fits Passage A on legalizing trading based on knowledge, but does not fit Passage B's position against insider-trading.
  E - Fits Passage A's position on trading based on obtained information, and does not fit Passage B's emphasis on transparency and equal access to information.

  The choice that most closely fits Passage A but not Passage B is E.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading helps the stock market reflect a more accurate assessment of a company's value, while passage B argues that insider-trading compromises market fairness, transparency, and investor confidence.
  
  Let's analyze the choices:
  A: Prohibits trading based on uneven information - This aligns with passage B, not A.
  B: Allows trading based on analysis but not insider position - This also aligns with passage B, not A.
  C: Prohibits trades that undermine investor confidence - This aligns with passage B, not A.
  D: Legalizes selling but not buying based on inside info - This doesn't align completely with either passage A or B, but A states that insider trading helps ensure accurate stock pricing, so this choice is closer to A than B.
  E: Legalizes insider-trading - This aligns with passage A but may also partly align with passage B if the information is not obtained unlawfully. However, passage B values transparency and a level playing field, so allowing insider trading might still be against passage B's overall argument.

  The best choice that conforms to the position of passage A but not passage B is choice D.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that using specialized knowledge in stock trading is part of the stock market's normal functioning.
  Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency and equal access to information for all participants in the stock market.
  
  Choice A would align more with Passage B's emphasis on equal access to information.
  Choice B permits trading based on analysis, which aligns with Passage A's argument, but prohibits trading based on inside position, which goes against Passage B's emphasis on transparency. So, this option is a potential choice.
  Choice C aligns more with Passage B, as it focuses on protecting investor confidence.
  Choice D partially legalizes insider trading, which may align with Passage A. However, it still prohibits buying, which goes against the argument made in Passage A that all relevant information should be spread widely and quickly.
  Choice E legalizes insider trading as long as it's not acquired through unlawful means, which aligns with Passage A's argument that using specific knowledge is part of the normal functioning of the stock market, and doesn't fit with Passage B's emphasis on transparency.
  
  Based on the thoughts above, choice E conforms most closely to the position in Passage A while not aligning with Passage B. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
Passage A argues that trading based on specialized knowledge is part of the stock market's function and that actions that help stock prices reflect accurate assessments are beneficial. Passage B argues for transparency in the market and implies that insider trading is unfair and could lead to a loss of investor confidence. A law that supports the perspective of passage A and not that of passage B would protect specialized knowledge trading while not aligning with full transparency.

Choices Analysis:
A: Prohibiting trading based on non-shared information contradicts both passage A and passage B, so it is incorrect.
B: Allowing trading based on stock analysis but prohibiting trading based on insider information aligns with passage B but not passage A, so it is incorrect.
C: Prohibiting trading that undermines investor confidence supports passage B but not passage A, so it is incorrect.
D: Legalizing selling based on inside information (dropping price) but prohibiting buying (rising price) is partly in line with passage A's view but does not fully align with either passage, so it is incorrect.
E: Legalizing trading based on inside information (assuming no unlawful acquisition) aligns with passage A's view and not passage B's, so it is correct.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that prions reproduce themselves in an unusual way, by initiating a chain reaction that changes the structure of normal prions into abnormal, pathogenic conformations. This reproduction and the resulting plaque formation lead to the destruction of nerve cells, resulting in CJD. This information supports the idea that if abnormally shaped prions could not reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains how prions are abnormal proteins that reproduce themselves through a chain reaction of transforming normally shaped prions. It states that if we could prevent this cascade process of prion reproduction, CJD would not be fatal. Based on this information, it is most strongly supported that if abnormally shaped prions could not reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves by converting normal prions into their dangerous abnormal shape, thereby producing a plaque, which destroys nerve cells. This process leads to the development of CJD. It can be inferred that, if prions could not reproduce, they would not cause the disease.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens and can reproduce themselves in an unexpected way which can cause CJD.
  Option C states that If prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.
  Since reproduction is key to the infectious properties and the cascade process of prions, option C is most strongly supported by the passage.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage explains that researchers discovered that abnormally shaped prions can reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction in CJD.
  Considering that the disease is caused by these prions, it is logical to assume that if the prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction, transforming normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, which causes CJD. Therefore, if abnormally shaped prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause this chain reaction and, consequently, would not cause CJD.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage states that prions, which are a new type of protein pathogen, can reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations causes the plaque buildup in the brain and ultimately leads to the destruction of nerve cells, which causes CJD. The passage also mentions that if prions were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause the chain reaction and plaque buildup that leads to CJD.

Answer: C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that prions are able to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. It is implied that the reproduction is necessary for the development and progression of CJD, which is associated with prions.
  Therefore, if prions were not able to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD. The answer is C.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that abnormally shaped prions cause CJD by reproducing themselves in an unexpected way and initiating a chain reaction. This implies that if they were unable to reproduce themselves, they would not cause CJD.

  The answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The passage states that abnormally shaped prions cause CJD and have infectious properties.
- It is also mentioned that they reproduce themselves by inducing a chain reaction that transforms normally shaped prions on contact.
- Without this reproduction process, the prions would not propagate and cause CJD.
- So, the statement that not being able to reproduce would mean abnormally shaped prions do not cause CJD is supported by the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes that until the late 1970s, economists failed to account for increasing returns to scale, which is common in many industries. The increasing returns to scale idea, presented by the Pin Factory example, was hard to represent mathematically; hence, it was not part of mainstream economic thought. This problem stayed until economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the necessary rigor. The main point of the passage is about the economists' struggle to account for increasing returns to scale.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.

  The main point of the passage is that for a long time, economists have not properly accounted for increasing returns to scale because it was difficult to represent them mathematically. However, recent developments have allowed the idea of increasing returns to enter mainstream economic thought.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory since 1776. It explains that increasing returns to scale, as illustrated in the Pin Factory example, have been difficult to represent mathematically. As a result, mainstream economic thought was dominated by the assumption of diminishing returns. The passage shows that it was only since late 1970s that economists found ways to describe the Pin Factory with sufficient rigor, allowing this idea to surface in the mainstream of economic thought.

Conclusion:
  The main point of the passage is that economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

Action:
  Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:

  The passage discusses how the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (competition in a free market) are contradictory and how for almost two centuries, diminishing returns dominated economic theory while increasing returns remained relatively unexplored. The passage also mentions that only since the late 1970s have economists been able to represent increasing returns with enough rigor to be considered mainstream in economic thought. Thus, the main point of the passage revolves around the failure of economists to account for increasing returns to scale.

  Among the available choices:

  A: This choice is incorrect, as the passage discusses how mainstream economists have historically focused on diminishing, not increasing, returns to scale.
  B: This choice is incorrect, as the passage does not mention that the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily due to the mathematical rigor of diminishing returns.
  C: This choice is incorrect, as the passage does not compare the mathematical rigor of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  D: This choice is not the main point of the passage. While it mentions Adam Smith's role in understanding the market economy, the passage's focus is on the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts.
  E: This choice is correct, as it highlights the central idea that economists have, until recently, failed to adequately account for increasing returns to scale in many industries.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A seems to argue against insider trading laws and implies that trading based on superior knowledge is part of a functioning stock market. It also mentions insider nontrading and says it's reasonable.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and the fairness of the stock market.
  
  Analyzing the choices:
  A: Passage B explicitly states that insider trading undermines investor confidence, and Passage A doesn't focus on investor confidence. So the authors may not agree.
  B: Passage A argues against the regulation of insider trading, so the authors may not agree on the sharing of all information at the same time.
  C: Both passages seem to be in favor of investors using superior analysis, making this a point they might agree on.
  D: Passage A supports insider nontrading, and Passage B does not mention it. The authors may not agree on regulating it to the same extent as insider trading.
  E: Passage B clearly argues against insider trading, so the authors would not agree that it is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders.

  The authors would be most likely to agree on choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:

Passage A: 
- Stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread widely and quickly.
- Actions based on accurate information help stock prices reflect the company's value.

Passage B: 
- Transparency is a basic principle of the stock market.
- Success in the market can be gained through skill in analyzing information and making good investment decisions.

Both passages agree on the importance of information in the stock market. However, Passage A focuses on the benefit of actions based on accurate information for market efficiency, while Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency and equal access to information for all market participants.

The potential common ground between both passages is that they both imply the importance of analysis and decision-making based on available information.

Choice C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis seems to be a point both authors might agree on. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:

  Passage A argues that insider trading is part of the functioning of the stock market and helps ensure accurate stock prices, while Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and transparency in the market.
  
  A: Passage A argues insider trading helps the stock market function better, while Passage B believes it undermines investor confidence. They don't agree on this point.
  
  B: Passage A focuses on the benefits of trading based on specialized knowledge, while Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency and simultaneous access to information. They do not completely agree on this point.
  
  C: Passage A discusses how utilizing specialized knowledge can be beneficial in the stock market and Passage B highlights the importance of individual merit and skill in analyzing information. Both authors would likely agree on this point.

  D: Passage A speaks about insider nontrading as a widespread practice that does not warrant punishment. Passage B does not mention insider nontrading at all. They do not agree on this point.
  
  E: Passage A argues that insider trading can help stock prices reflect accurate information, while Passage B believes that it undermines market fairness. They do not agree on this point.

  Conclusion: The authors would most likely agree on choice C, that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A opposes the idea that insider trading is a crime, stating that stock markets work best when all relevant information is widely available and insiders help adjust stock prices. 
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines transparency in the stock market, creating an unfair advantage and decreasing investor confidence.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that:
  C: It is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.
  Reason: The authors both mention the importance of analyzing information and making informed decisions when investing in the stock market.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thoughts: 
- Passage A suggests that trading based on non-public information is part of the functioning stock market and having accurate information helps to correct stock prices and is beneficial to the stock market.
- Passage B argues that insider trading undermines the transparency of the market and unfairly compromises it, causing a loss of investor confidence, which ultimately could destroy the market.
- The authors of Passage A and Passage B both agree on the importance of investors having access to information, though they have different opinions on insider trading.

Looking at the choices:
A. Passage A argues that having accurate information is beneficial for the stock market, while Passage B says insider trading undermines investor confidence. This choice seems like a common point for both authors.
B. Passage B emphasizes the importance of all market participants having access to information at the same time but Passage A does not seem to insist on simultaneous availability.
C. This statement reflects both authors' acknowledgment of the importance of good stock analysis but does not address their disagreement regarding insider trading.
D. Passage A mentions insider nontrading but does not suggest regulating it, and Passage B does not address insider nontrading at all.
E. Passage A does not explicitly claim that insider trading is the best means for disseminating information, and Passage B opposes insider trading.

The best answer reflecting a common point for both authors is A since both passages agree on the importance of investor confidence even though they have different opinions on insider trading.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  A) Passage A talks about information dispersal being good for the stock market, and Passage B mentions that insider trading compromises the market leading to a loss of investor confidence.
  B) Passage B talks about transparency and information being available to all participants at the same time. Passage A doesn't directly say this but implies that the stock market works best when relevant information is as widely spread as possible.
  C) Passage A states that when someone does their homework and analyzes a stock, it doesn't make them a criminal; it means they've done their work. Passage B also discusses success being based on skill in analyzing information.
  D) Passage A mentions insider nontrading but doesn't suggest regulating it as insider trading. Passage B doesn't mention insider nontrading at all.
  E) Passage A says it helps when accurate information allows people to act, but never implies insider trading is the best means. Passage B argues against insider trading.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the benefits of insider trading and does not mention undermining investor confidence or regulation. Passage A supports using superior stock analysis to gain an advantage.
  Passage B strongly argues against insider trading, as it undermines the principle of transparency and investor confidence, but supports a transparent market where all information is available to all participants. Passage B agrees with Passage A on good investing decisions based on skillful analysis.
  
  The choice both authors would agree upon is:
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Looking for a statement that both authors agree on:

  - Passage A talks about the difference between insider trading and doing your homework. It doesn't directly mention investor confidence, but argues that insider trading helps stock prices reflect accurate assessments.
  - Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and compromises the market.

  A: This choice is only agreed upon by the author of Passage B.

  - Passage A argues that stock markets work best when information is spread quickly and widely.
  - Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency in a stock market, and that everyone should have access to the same information at the same time.

  B: Both authors agree on the importance of information dissemination in the stock market. They may have different opinions regarding the role of insider trading, but they both value transparency.

  - Passage A supports investors gaining knowledge or advantage through superior stock analysis.
  - Passage B emphasizes success based on individual merit and skill, aligning with the idea of good investing decisions through skillful stock analysis.

  C: Both authors seem to agree that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage through superior stock analysis.

  - Passage A mentions insider nontrading as something that happens every day and thinks it's reasonable.
  - Passage B does not mention insider nontrading at all.

  D: This choice doesn't have agreement from both authors since Passage B doesn't mention insider nontrading.

  - Passage A argues that insider trading helps stock prices reflect accurate assessments.
  - Passage B argues against the practice of insider trading.

  E: This choice doesn't have the agreement of both authors since Passage B doesn't support insider trading.

  B and C are the closest choices where both authors agree. Since B emphasizes the importance of equal information, which is more closely connected to the main theme of both passages rather than just stock analysis in C, choice B is the best option. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought process:

Passage A says that acting on information to make stock prices reflect accurate information is good for everyone in the stock market, but it does not explicitly mention investor confidence.

Passage B states that insider trading causes a loss of investor confidence, undermining the market. This indicates that the authors of Passage B agree with A.

Passage A specifically implies that stock markets work best when all information is spread widely and quickly, while Passage B mentions that transparency in trading decisions is essential. Therefore, both authors would agree with B.

Passage A suggests that if you analyze a stock and make a decision based on your analysis, it is not illegal. Passage B emphasizes that success can be gained through individual merit and skill in analyzing information. Thus, both authors would agree with C.

Neither passage mentions anything about regulating insider nontrading, so the authors would not agree with D.

Neither passage supports that insider trading is the best means for disseminating information, so the authors would not agree with E.

Based on the passages above, the authors would most likely agree with B and C. Between those options, C is more specific and directly addressed in both passages.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A: It explains that having more information than others can help the stock market function better and mentions insider nontrading, without showing any concern about it.
  Passage B: It argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and calls for transparency in the stock market.

Comparing both passages and looking for a point of agreement:
  - Both passages don't mention regulating insider nontrading (D).
  - Passage B opposes insider trading while Passage A does not see it as a problem; therefore, they don't agree that it's the best means to disseminate information (E).
  - Passage A supports using more information to profit in the stock market, while Passage B calls for transparency and equal access; they don't fully agree on whether all information should be available to all participants (B).
  - Passage A could be interpreted as supporting the idea that skilled stock analysis is appropriate for investors to gain an advantage, and Passage B states that success should be based on skill; therefore, they agree on choice C.

Conclusion: The authors would be most likely to agree that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained
Response 0:

  The last sentence of the second paragraph says "Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing."
  
  This sentence is highlighting a fact about the Great Migration that is not clear and needs explaining. It mentions that it is unclear why migration continued even when the income differences between the North and South started to decrease.

  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states: "Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip."
  This sentence is discussing the role of early migrants in providing information that helped facilitate the migration experience for others.
  The primary purpose of this sentence is to explain how early migrants helped reduce the difficulties and costs of migration for subsequent migrators.
  The answer that best represents this purpose is "B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events."

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph states: "Less clear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing."
  This sentence presents an aspect of the Great Migration that is not well understood or explained: why migration continued and accelerated even when the income gap was narrowing.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of this sentence is to present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph is: "Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip."
  This sentence is describing the role of early migrants in providing valuable information to those who have not yet made the trip, which is relevant to the Great Migration.

  Let's evaluate the answer choices:

  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided. - No, this sentence doesn't indicate the previous research was misguided.
  
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events. - This seems accurate since the last sentence extends their explanation by mentioning how early migrants provided useful information to those who had not yet migrated.
  
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915. - No, this sentence doesn't challenge that view.
  
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain. - Yes, the sentence is presenting a fact, but the authors are not seeking to explain it further; they are using it to add detail to their explanation.
  
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained. - No, this sentence doesn't suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.

  The correct answer seems to be B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.
Action: Answer("B")

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the relationship between the two passages?
Choices:
  A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.
  B: Passage A denounces a judicial custom,while passage B proposes improvements to that custom.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Thought:
  In the passage, primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances give plants their characteristic taste and smells.
  We need to find an analogy where one set of components is necessary for function and the other gives distinctive characteristics but is not required for function.

Choice A: relates to electricity which is essential for operation, but generators are also essential when the power source is unavailable, not just distinctive characteristics.
Choice B: Mechanical components are necessary for function, while paint and taillights provide distinctive look and serve non-essential functions. This option aligns with the primary and secondary plant substances.
Choice C: Both mechanical and electrical components are required for operation, not just for providing distinctive characteristics.
Choice D: Both friction components and pneumatic components work together in braking systems, so this does not align with primary and secondary substances.
Choice E: Word processing programs and storage components are both necessary for computers in different ways; this does not match the primary and secondary substances concept.

Conclusion: Option B is the most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Primary substances are essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants and all plants have them. Secondary substances are not needed for growth or metabolism but provide distinctive smells and tastes, and aid in attraction of pollinators or defense against enemies.
  
  We need to find an analogy where one set of components is essential for proper functioning, and another set of components is not essential but provides some additional benefits.

  A: Both electrical power and generators are essential for the functioning of hospitals. 
  B: Engines and transmissions are essential for automobiles; paint and taillights are not essential for the cars to run but provide additional benefits. This is similar to the relationship between primary and secondary substances in plants.
  C: Both mechanical and electrical components are essential for the operation of clothing factories.
  D: Both friction and pneumatic components are essential for the braking system in trains.
  E: Both word processing programs and storage systems are essential for computers to work as word processors.

Response 2:
Thought:
- Primary substances in plants are crucial for growth and proper functioning; secondary substances give distinctive tastes and smells but are not necessary for growth.
- A choice should present two categories of components/elements, with one category essential for the main functioning and the other category providing additional/non-essential features.

Choices analysis:
A: Essential electrical power & backup generators - both necessary, so not analogous.
B: Essential mechanical components & non-essential features like paint and taillights - closely analogous.
C: Mechanical components & electrical components - both necessary, so not analogous.
D: Different parts of a necessary braking system, so not analogous. 
E. Both components necessary for a word processing functionality. So, not analogous.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  In the given context, primary substances are required for the growth and proper functioning of plants, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells but have no known role in internal processes. We need to find an analogous relationship.
  
  Let's analyze each choice:
  A: Power is essential, and generators serve as a backup source; both are related to functioning - not analogous.
  B: Engines and transmissions are needed for automobiles to run (functioning), and paint and taillights give a distinctive look (non-essential, additional features) - this choice appears to be analogous.
  C: Both mechanical and electrical components play a role in the functioning of clothing factories - not analogous.
  D: Both friction and pneumatic components are needed for the braking system to function - not analogous.
  E: Word processing programs are essential for functioning as word processors, and storage location does not represent a distinction between essential and non-essential - not analogous.

  Based on the analysis, choice B is the most closely analogous relationship to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The question asks for an analogy to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances. Primary substances are essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Primary substances in the plants are essential for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are chemicals that have no known role in the plants' growth or metabolism but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  
  Let's analyze the choices to find a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.

  A: Electrical power is essential for the proper functioning of hospitals, while generators provide electricity only when the usual source of power is unavailable. This doesn't match the primary-secondary substance relationship.
  
  B: Mechanical components are necessary for automobiles to run, while features like paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve some functions, but automobiles can run without them. This seems analogous to primary and secondary substances.
  
  C: Mechanical components are required for the operation of clothing factories, while electrical components supply the power needed to run the mechanical components. Both play an essential role, but the electrical components don't serve a secondary/distinguishing role.
  
  D: Braking systems have both friction components and pneumatic components, but both are essential for the braking system to work. This doesn't match the primary-secondary substance relationship.
  
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors, and both memory systems are required for storing these programs. This doesn't match the primary-secondary substance relationship.

  Choice B closely matches the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Primary substances in plants are necessary for growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The question asks for an analogy involving two categories of components or substances, one essential for functioning, and the other providing a distinctive feature without being necessary for the primary functioning.

  A: Electrical power is essential for a hospital's functioning; generators are essential backup source-of-power.
  B: Mechanical components are necessary for automobiles to run; features like paint and taillights provide distinctiveness and secondary functions but are not essential for the primary function of running.
  C: Mechanical components are required for clothing factories to operate; electrical components supply power but do not participate directly in the primary manufacturing process.
  D: A braking system is necessary for trains to stop; the friction and pneumatic components work together as part of the braking system.
  E: Word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors; the storage location doesn't affect their primary function.

  Choice B best represents the relationships between primary and secondary substances in plants because engines and transmissions are required for automobiles to run, like primary substances in plants, while features such as paint and taillights serve secondary functions but are not necessary for the primary function of the automobile
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Primary substances in plants are required for growth and proper functioning (essential components).
  Secondary substances in plants provide distinctive tastes and smells and help in defense against insects (addition features, not essential but beneficial).
  
  We need to find an analogous set of relationships where there is a distinction between essential components and additional features that are not essential but provide some benefits.

  A: Generators are not analogous to secondary substances because they are still essential components when a primary source of power is unavailable.
  
  B: Mechanical components are essential (primary substances analogy), while paint, taillights provide distinctive look and serve other functions (secondary substances analogy).
  
  C: Mechanical components are essential, but electrical components, like wires and transformers, supply power to run mechanical components, and thus they are still essential but not analogous to secondary substances.
  
  D: Both friction and pneumatic components are essential for the braking system to function and are not analogous to secondary substances.
  
  E: Word processing programs are essential for the computer to function as a word processor, and storage options are still essential components related to the word processing function.

  The answer is B: mechanical components of automobiles are analogous to primary substances, and features like paint and taillights are analogous to secondary substances.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Primary substances are essential for plants' growth and functioning, while secondary substances are not essential but give plants distinctive characteristics and serve specific functions (such as attracting insects or defending against them).
  
  We need to find an option where one set of components is essential for the functioning, while the other serves specific functions or gives distinctive characteristics but is not necessary for the functioning.
  
  Choice A: Both electrical power and generators are essential for the functioning of hospitals, so this is not analogous.
  Choice B: Engines and transmissions are essential for automobiles, while paint and taillights are not but serve specific functions (prevent rust, improve safety), making it the most closely analogous to plants and primary/secondary substances.
  Choice C: Both mechanical components and electrical components are essential for the functioning of clothing factories.
  Choice D: Both friction components and pneumatic components are essential for the braking system of trains.
  Choice E: Both word processing programs and memory systems are essential for computers to function as word processors.

  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components are essential for cars and features like paint and taillights are not essential but serve specific functions, closely analogous to primary and secondary substances in plants.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to find an analogy with primary and secondary substances. Primary substances are essential for functioning, while secondary substances provide unique characteristics but are not essential.
  
  A: Doesn't fit the analogy since both electrical power and generators are essential for proper functioning.
  B: Mechanical components are essential for automobiles, while paint and taillights give a distinctive look, which is a nice analogy to primary and secondary substances.
  C: Both mechanical and electrical components are essential for operation in this choice.
  D: Both friction and pneumatic components are necessary for the braking system.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary, and so are their methods of storage; therefore, not an analogy.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 99 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Taruskin's position is about how high art is produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage states that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin must engage in an analysis that claims enduring high art that seems to go against the grain of elite values actually embodies those ideals in hidden ways.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Taruskin and his sociohistorical interpretation of art in relation to the elite class.
  It mentions that for Taruskin's analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and consensus about the world and life.
  Additionally, it says that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin claim that in hidden ways, enduring art embodies the ideals of the elite, even if they overtly disapprove of such work.
  This suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite must actually support that ideology in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin engage in an analysis of art similar to Freudian analysis, claiming that art that goes against the grain of elite values actually embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways if it endures. This statement commits Taruskin to the view that if high art endures and seems to undermine the elite ideology, it actually supports it in some concealed manner.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage is discussing Taruskin's view on art that appears to go against the ideology of the elite but still endures. Taruskin suggests that this kind of art, despite seeming to undermine the elite's ideals, must embody those ideals in hidden ways for his analysis to work. This idea supports choice C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
According to the passage, Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art "produced by and for political and social elites" in a way that reflects the views of those elites. When discussing art that goes against the grain of elite values but still endures, Taruskin must argue that such art embodies the ideals of the elite in hidden ways, even if the elite overtly disapproved of the work. 

Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if high art endures, even when it appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, it must actually support that ideology in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Taruskin is mentioned as a sociohistorical critic who believes in analyzing art that embodies the elite's ideals.
  The passage states that for this kind of analysis to work, the elite must have a recognizable identity, consensus, and the artists must not subvert the ideals for their own reasons.
  The passage also suggests that the sociohistorical critic must engage in a Freudian analysis, claiming that even in art that appears to defy elite values, hidden ways embody the elite's ideals.

Based on the passage and Taruskin's position on art analysis, Taruskin would likely agree with the view that endures high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite still supports it in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the view of Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics, who focus on art being produced by and for political/social elites, specifically looking at how the art embodies the ideology of the elite.
  Taruskin's position is that if a piece of art endures, it reveals the ideals of the elite, even if they overtly disapproved of it.
  It suggests that Taruskin must claim that such art supports the elite's ideology in hidden ways if it endures.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin claim that some enduring art reflected the ideals of the elite in hidden ways even if they overtly disapproved.
  This implies that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Taruskin's view involves the idea that art produced "the second way" embodies the ideology of the elite and that sociohistorical critics can analyze the ways it does so.
  This suggests that even if the art seems to go against the values of the elite or is disapproved by the elite but endures, there must be some hidden ways it embodies their ideals.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position would be committed to the view that if high art endures and seems to undermine the ideology of the elite, it still supports that ideology in some way.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Taruskin's position focuses on the sociohistorical interpretation of art, where art is "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The passage states that the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis and claim that enduring art that was overtly disapproved by the elite actually embodies the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
  This leads to the conclusion that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if high art endures and appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, it actually supports that ideology in some hidden way.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

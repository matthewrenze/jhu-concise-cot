Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions the phenomenon of rivalry, where people want their relative position to improve regardless of their actual income.
  Passage B suggests that the desire to create value benefits society and makes people feel successful and happy.
  Neither passage implies that the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is altruistic or egocentric, happy or miserable, misguided or admirable, or lucky or primitive. Therefore, we can eliminate all choices.
  None of the terms in Passage A or Passage B directly describe the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
 Answer: None of the Above
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B explain that people's happiness is based on their relative prosperity.
  Passage A explains that people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  Passage B explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  Passage B argues that people use material wealth to show that they are successful and that they create value.
  Therefore, a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is not insular or cosmopolitan, altruistic or egocentric, happy or miserable, lucky or primitive, or misguided.
  It depends on the motive behind it. According to passage B, it could be because the person wants to create value, which is admirable.
  The most likely term that Passage A and Passage B would use to describe such a person is neither insular nor cosmopolitan, altruistic nor egocentric, happy nor miserable, lucky nor primitive, but rather it depends on their underlying motivation.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thoughts: 
  In Passage A, Solnick and Hemenway illustrate this phenomenon with the study which shows that people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  In Passage B, the author argues that it is not just about one-upmanship and that people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous but that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Therefore, both passages suggest that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are NOT misguided, but rather that they have a desire to create value.
  The correct answer is D: misguided, admirable.
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that relative prosperity determines happiness.
  People compare themselves with others to evaluate their success.
  Preference for relative prosperity is evident in the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  Passage B argues that people who earn more feel successful and create value.
  The desire to create value benefits society.
  The person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is not described as "happy" or "miserable" in either passage.
  The author's tone towards this person is not clear.
  The answer may be "misguided" or "admirable."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Both passages consider the issue of wanting to have more money than others.
  Passage A describes the phenomenon of rivalry, considering that people are happy to be poorer when their relative position improves.
  Passage B rejects the notion that people want to earn more money out of an instinct of one-upmanship, proposing instead that people want to create value.
  Thus, neither of the passages would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "egocentric" or "miserable."
  Likewise, neither would describe such a person as "primitive" or "lucky."
  Passage A would be more likely to use the term "misguided," while Passage B would be more inclined to use the term "admirable."
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses two phenomena where people compare their income with some norm to push up the norm - habituation and rivalry.
  In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  In Passage B, the authors argue that people desire to create value, and wanting to create value benefits society.
  Neither passages suggest that individuals wanting to make more money than his or her neighbors are altruistic or admirable.
  However, passage B mentions that people who earn more generally view themselves as successful, and it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The authors of passage A and passage B discuss the phenomenon of people comparing their wealth and income to others in their social group which affects their happiness.
  Passage A explains the concept of rivalary: people want to improve their relative position compared to others.
  Passage B argues that earning more makes people happier because it makes them feel successful and that they have created value.
  Passage B suggests that the desire to create value benefits society and therefore this is a positive thing.
  Considering these thoughts, judging a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "misguided" seems normative and does not match the tone of the passages.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A indicates that people are motivated to increase their income in order to socially compare themselves with others and improve their relative position.
  Passage B suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors feel a sense of achievement and happiness from creating value and being successful.
  Neither passage uses terms to describe this person as "insular" or "cosmopolitan", "altruistic" or "egocentric", "lucky" or "primitive".
  Both passages suggest that this person's desire to make more money than their neighbors is driven by competition and achievement.
  Passage A portrays the tendency to compare oneself with others and want to improve their relative position negatively, while Passage B describes it as a positive desire to create value.
  Therefore, neither "misguided" nor "admirable" seem to fit the description for this person.
  The best answer seems to be "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passages discuss the reasons why people's income can affect their happiness, but not necessarily how much money they make relative to others.
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study, in which people chose an income based on how it compared to that of others.
  While passage B discusses people's desire to "create value" and view themselves as successful.
  There is no indication that passage A or passage B would use any of the terms in choices A, C, D, or E.
  Choice B may be a candidate as it could be seen as relevant to the theories about why people compare their own income to that of others.
  However, neither passage A nor passage B use the terms altruistic or egocentric.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage B suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors do so because they desire to create value and to feel successful.
  The authors of Passage A also refer to "rivalry", suggesting that people compare their income to that of others and are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position is improved.
  Both Passages do not suggest that the person is insular, egocentric, miserable, misguided, lucky or primitive.
  The person is characterized as wanting to create value and to feel successful, which is admirable.
  The answer is D: admirable.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: The information in the passage most helps to answer a which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: What laboratory experiments were conducted by Molina or Rowland in their research on CFCs?
  B: What was the estimated concentration of CFCs in the atmosphere in 1 987?

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: Based on what can be inferred from their titles, the relationship between the documents in which one of the following pairs Js most ,analogpus to the relationship between passage A and passage B?

  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power of nullification and argues that the jury should not have this power. 
  Passage B defends the practice of jury nullification by arguing that it can serve a useful function in the legal system and can help correct injustices.
  In order to find a pair of passages that have a similar relationship, we need to find two passages that have opposing or conflicting views on a similar topic.
  Neither "Cameras in the Courtroom" nor "Televising Courtroom Proceedings" seem to fit this description.
  Only the pair in option C seems to have an opposing relationship that a pair of passages would likely have.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against the use of jury nullification, while Passage B defends it.
  The documents in the answer choices describe two different sides or perspectives on a particular issue.
  After analyzing the answer choices, there are only two options that convey opposing perspectives.
  Answer choice A argues against televising courtroom proceedings, while Answer choice B defends it.
  The relationship between Answer choice A and B is similar to that of Passage A and B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the problems created by jury nullification, suggesting that the jury's power to nullify can be dangerous.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful tool in certain circumstances as a way to assist the legislature when laws may not be appropriate for a specific defendant or may be unjust.
  Option A "Cameras in the Courtroom: A Perversion of Justice? 'The Pros and Cons of Televising Courtroom regard as trivial." The first title of the pair suggests that cameras in the courtroom may have negative impacts on justice; however, the second title provides a balanced view of the benefits of televising courtroom proceedings.
  Option B "Cameras in the Courtroom: Three Central Issues in the Debate 'The Unexpected Benefits of Permitting Cameras in Court.'" The first title identifies key issues in the debate over cameras in courtrooms. The second title explains how the use of cameras can have benefits that were not previously considered.
  Option C "The Inherent Dangers of Permitting Cameras in Court 'How Televising Courtroom Proceedings Can Assist the Law.'" The first title suggests that the use of cameras in courtrooms can be dangerous. The second title implies that televising courtroom proceedings can help the legal system.
  Option D "The Troublesome History of Cameras in the Courtroom 'The Laudable Motives Behind Televised Courtroom Proceedings.'" The first title suggests that cameras in courtrooms have faced issues in the past. The second title talks about the positive motivations behind televising courtroom proceedings.
  Option E "Why Cameras Should Be Banned from the Courtroom 'The Inevitability of Televised Courtroom Proceedings.'" The first title suggests that cameras in courtrooms should be prohibited. The second title implies that televised courtroom proceedings are inevitable.
  
  After evaluating each option, it seems that option B has the most similar relationship as the relationship between Passage A and Passage B. Passage A and Passage B have different views on the validity of jury nullification while option B talks about the different sides of a debate over cameras in courtrooms. Therefore, choosing one side in a particular debate as opposed to examining it in more detail is comparable to highlighting two sides of a controversial issue with different opinions.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

The passage discusses how industries and academic institutions support the patentability of biotechnological discoveries and how such patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are gaining the attention of scientists. Nonetheless, concerns have arisen about limitations placed on the access to research materials through patent enforcement or contractual agreements. The resistance against patenting biotechnology seems to confuse patent rights with the control of access to biological materials. The article explores the question of whether patenting would hinder or spur basic research since patents incentivize scientists to innovate.  
The correct answer should capture the main idea of the passage, which is to explore the relation between biotechnology patenting and research and the questions that have arisen about access to research materials. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage presents different views regarding biotechnology patents and basic research.
  Some researchers fear access to biological materials may be restricted as a result of patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions, leading to a perceived threat to basic research.
  However, others believe that patents are necessary to provide scientists with incentives to innovate.
  Moreover, patents may not hinder but actually spur basic research since they come with economic rewards and licensing control over the use of discoveries.
  The passage does not say that recent controversies arose from a shift from a communal tradition to a market-driven approach.
  The passage also does not say that the current system of patent protection is unfair.
  The passage argues against the view of academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research, but it does not say that their concerns are misguided.
  However, the passage does say that enforcing a biotechnology patent against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The author describes a shift away from communal sharing to market-driven approach to basic scientific research. 
The shift has caused tension between biotechnology researchers and scientists. 
Biotechnology researchers advocate for patent protection, while some academic researchers resist it. 
The concern that patenting will hinder basic research is not entirely justified, due to an exception to patent infringement for non-commercial research. 
Patents actually benefit scientists by providing an incentive for innovation. 
The main point is that biotechnology patents are a controversial topic in the scientific community, as advocates of patent protection and communal sharing have competing interests. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage discusses patents and biotechnology research. 
There are concerns about how biotechnology patents may impact basic research, such as access to research materials.
Some fear that patent owners may charge high fees that researchers cannot afford, making it difficult for them to conduct research. 
However, patents also incentivize innovation. 
The passage concludes that patents are unlikely to impede basic research.
Based on this, the main point of the passage is most accurately expressed as:
Researchers' concerns over the potential negative impacts of biotechnology patents on their ability to conduct basic research are largely unfounded because enforcing a patent through patent litigation is expensive, and judges usually respect a non-commercial research exception to patent infringement, and patents incentivize innovation. 
Choice D is the closest, but it lacks the emphasis on the incentives for innovation that patents provide.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the pros and cons of patenting biological material in biotechnology.
  The author believes that while some researchers fear patenting biological material results in restricting access to research materials or charging prohibitively high fees, involving a patent will actually spur basic research.
  The last paragraph of the passage sums up the passage best.
  The author contends that academic researchers' concerns about biotechnology patents negatively affecting their ability to conduct basic research are not true.
  Rather, patents give strong motivation to scientific innovation, and whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and non-commercial research, is questionable.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses plants and their chemical composition.
  The primary chemicals are essential for growth and are found in all plants.
  The secondary chemicals are not necessary for growth and help give plants their unique taste and smell.
  Insects have played a role in the evolution of plants' secondary substances.
  Some substances arose as defenses against insects and some substances attract pollinating insects.
  Insects must adapt to the new defenses of plants and may evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses primary and secondary chemical substances in plants, and secondary substances are the ones that give plants their characteristic smells and tastes.
  Insects play a crucial role in the development of secondary substances in plants because some secondary substances serve as scents that attract pollinating insects, while other secondary substances act as biochemical defenses against insects.
  There is an evolutionary competition between plants and insects, resulting in insects switching their food sources and identifying suitable plants by their characteristic flavors or odors.
  The passage does not provide any support for options C, D, and E.
  Option B is incorrect because the passage states that some secondary substances act as biochemical defenses against insects; therefore, most of these plants may not be used as food by many insects.
  Option A is the correct answer because the passage explicitly states that secondary chemicals have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism; however, they are crucial to the lives of different types of plants.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Secondary substances in plants give them distinct taste and smell.
  Some secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms without damaging plants.
  Other secondary substances are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects; some of these substances cause unpleasant symptoms or even death to insects.
  Some secondary substances warn insects of the presence of harmful substances, dissuading them from feeding.
  Insects switch to other food sources or evolve to circumvent plants' defenses, which is the outcome of hundreds of millions of years of competition.
  As the competition progresses, fewer and fewer plants remain suitable food sources for any one insect species. Many insects tend to identify narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
  Based on these ideas:
    Choice A is accurate, because secondary substances have no known role in plants’ growth or metabolism.
    Choice B is incorrect, because most plants with defense systems are not used as food by many insects.
    Choice C is incorrect, because insects can identify feed sources by taste or smell rather than by other means.
    Choice D is incorrect, because most secondary substances that are toxic to insects have survived in related plant species, not in unrelated ones.
    Choice E is incorrect because the passage does not discuss toxic substances that evolved in correlation with secondary substances, but are not themselves secondary substances.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the characteristic scents and tastes of plants are due to secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, and they have arisen by mutation in individual plants.
  Natural selection retains secondary substances that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, that serve as chemical defenses against plant enemies, or that are characteristic smells or tastes warning insects off.
  The evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects has led to fewer and fewer suitable food sources for any one species of insect, and species have become associated with restricted groups of plants.
  The passage provides the most support for inferring that secondary substances in plants:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discussed primary and secondary substances found in plants.
  According to the passage, secondary substances can be biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects.
  Insects must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses to survive.
  Insects eventually evolve the ability to identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
  The competition led to a few species of insects becoming associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
  The passage provides the most support for inferring that B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses secondary substances in plants and their role in providing plant defenses against insects.
  Secondary substances might serve as biochemical defenses against plant enemies, attract pollinators to blooms or warn insects of harmful elements.
  The competition between plants and insects for survival has led to a further evolution of insect ways to overcome plant defenses.
  The passage does not explicitly mention whether some secondary substances have unknown roles in plant metabolism or growth or whether most plants are used as food by a range of insects, excluding them as the correct options.
  Options D and E suggest that toxic secondary substances are key to plant defense against insects but only a few species have survived to date and that toxicity is not a secondary substance.
  Option B provides a possible explanation as to why some plants are still commonly fed upon by insects despite the presence of chemical defense mechanisms.
  Option C is not discussed in the passage, it is incorrect.
  A conclusion can be derived from the passage that supports Option A as well. Certain chemicals that are not involved in plant growth and metabolism allow plants to have varied defense mechanisms against insects.
  However, Option B has more implicit support in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the secondary substances present in plants, which provide distinctive tastes and smells and are involved in plants' defenses against insects.
  Some of these substances attract insects, while others serve as biochemical defenses by causing insect's unpleasant symptoms or even death.
  Insects must switch to other foods or evolve mechanisms to circumvent these defenses.
  The competition between insects and plants causes insects to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
  The passage does not discuss options B, C, D, or E.
  Option A seems to match the passage's discussion on secondary substances.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Secondary substances are the chemicals that give plants distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances have arisen to develop biochemical defenses against plant enemies.
  Some secondary substances are specific smells or tastes that deter insects from feeding and warn of harmful substances.
  Insects compete with plants, which develop chemical defense systems against certain species of insect.
  Insects eventually evolve the ability to identify plants by their characteristic odors or flavors.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Natural selection conserves chemical substances that function as a biochemical defense against insects.
  Insects and plants have engaged in an evolutionary competition for millions of years.
  Insects have found ways to circumvent plant defenses.
  Based on the information provided, the passage provides the most support for inferring B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Secondary substances of plants give them distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects mostly eat plants, but they also played a major role in helping to create many of the secondary substances in plants today.
  Genetic mutations can create new secondary substances in individual plants, but only those that increase the chances of organisms' surviving and reproducing can be passed down through natural selection.
  Secondary substances are used for a variety of purposes, such as attracting pollinating insects, defending against plant enemies or warning against harmful substances. 
  Insects eventually evolve the ability to identify plants with characteristic tastes or smells that they can circumvent and these restricted plants species become the insects' preferred food.
  Therefore, the passage provides most support for inferring B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought:
- The paragraph mentions that increasing returns create a natural tendency towards monopoly, because a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
- Also, the Pin Factory example where Smith emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size by which the employees by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
- The best example that illustrates this concept of increasing returns to scale is the one that refers to a scenario where a large collective unit can produce more as compared to its relatively smaller counterparts.
- Among the given choices, Options A and C does not talk about the collective unit.
- Option B describes how a large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources that enable the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. But this does not relate exactly to increased benefits leading to monopoly.
- Option D describes the advances in technology that enable the Lobster industry as a whole to catch more lobsters in a single day with the same number of traps. It is the technology that enhances returns and not the size as such.
- The best-fit answer is Option E, that describes how a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This example exhibits the concept of larger entities leading to increased efficiency and not being subject to a monopoly.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale is the concept of greater efficiency resulting from increased size.
  The example of a pin factory in the passage illustrated this concept.
  This concept is opposed to the natural tendency toward monopoly because a larger business can achieve larger scale and lower costs, driving smaller firms out of business.
  Therefore, the concept of diminishing returns to scale is needed to ensure that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Option A is not a good example because it describes improved productivity leading to the employment of fewer editors, which is the opposite of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B is not a good example because it describes a larger colony that is better able to divide up work, which is not the result of increased size or scaling.
  Option C is not a good example because it describes a school district accommodating more students by switching to year-round operation, which is the opposite of a larger business increasing efficiency.
  Option D is not a good example because it describes the use of advances in technology making it easier for lobsters to get through traps, which is not an example of greater efficiency resulting from increased size or scaling. 
  Option E is not a good example because it describes a larger number of colonies resulting from the division of one colony, which is not the result of increased size or scaling.
  The only option that describes an example of greater efficiency resulting from increased size is the pin factory described in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is not given and cannot be determined based on the options.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The paragraph describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns mean that a bigger factory with more specialized workers can produce more than a smaller factory with less specialized workers.
  This choice should reflect this concept.
  Option A describes decreasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a different concept outside the scope of the paragraph.
  Option C describes a method for accommodating more students, but does not increase the productivity of the existing building.
  Option D suggests an increase in the efficiency of the existing process, but not necessarily increasing returns to scale.
  Only option E describes a scenario in which dividing the colony creates more workers who can then specialize and increase productivity to a greater extent than if all ants remained in one colony. Therefore, the best choice is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The passage explains that increasing returns to scale arise when bigger firms can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than small firms.
- The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale, in which bigger factories can specialize workers and produce more pins per worker.
- None of the answer choices describes the concept of the pin factory that has been explained in the passage.
- Choice B describes a scenario in which one colony divides into two and becomes more prosperous. However, this scenario does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
- Choice A, C, D do not describe any scenario that relates to increasing returns to scale.
- Therefore, I will select choice E as the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage is that as a business grows larger, its employees can specialize in narrow tasks and produce far more than they could if each worked independently.
  It is best illustrated by an example in which a larger enterprise has an advantage over a smaller one.
  From the given choices, answer B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar, illustrates the concept the best, as the productivity of the bee colony increases as it grows larger.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more the factory can produce per worker.
  Of the options provided, B and E involve the division of labor and specialization as the number of individuals in the organization increases.
  Option B describes how a larger bee colony can divide up the work of processing the nectar and can collect more nectar as a result.
  Therefore, B best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  In the second paragraph, the author explains the concept of increasing returns to scale with the parable of the pin factory.
  The author describes that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency towards monopoly and larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business.
  The example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale is the one where larger size leads to lower costs and increased productivity.
  Among the choices, option D explains that the lobster industry as a whole can catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  Increased efficiency and decreased cost with the same resources is a clear indication of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The second paragraph describes that larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The concept of increasing returns to scale means larger scale leads to relatively greater output.
  E shows a phenomenon of increasing returns to scale through the formation of more prosperous, competing colonies.
  The other choices do not illustrate increasing returns to scale as described in the passage. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is the ability to increase production with the same resources by increasing the scale.
  In the passage, the Pin Factory is used to describe this concept.
  Option A describes decreasing returns to scale because it leads to a reduction in the number of editors.
  Option B describes a scenario where efficiency is increased by specialization, but it does not describe an increase in scale.
  Option C describes a change in the way students are accommodated but it does not result in an increase in output or scale.
  Option D describes an increase in the industry's output to the same resources by advancing technology, which is similar to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes two competing colonies growing large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies containing more ants, which is similar to an increase in scale or output.
  Options D and E are close, but the answer focus on the concept related to increasing returns to scale and not just an increase in production or output.
  Therefore, the best option is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more efficient the firm can become in terms of cost-benefit ratios. The pin factory is cited as an example of a company that can produce more efficiently by increasing scale. 
  The choice that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale would involve an example where a larger system is able to improve efficiency or productivity by scaling up.
  Options A, B, C, and E do not involve an example where efficiency or productivity is improved via scaling up.
  Option D, on the other hand, describes an industry that is able to catch significantly more lobsters with the same number of traps because of technology advancements. 
  Since this is an example where the industry becomes more efficient with the same number of traps, the best choice would be D.

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the use of abstract symbols to represent nouns, such as the sign for "sheep" is a circled cross.
  The author does not provide any information or opinion indicating that any other sign could replace the sign for "sheep" without a significant loss of meaning.
  The passage does not compare the representation of the sign for "sheep" with the way the sign for "metal" gets its meaning, so we cannot conclude that they get their meanings in radically different ways.
  The passage does not state that the sign for "sheep" was chosen because sheep were an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  The passage states that the tokens are the overlooked predecessors of the written word and give insights into the origins of writing. The author supports Schmandt-Besserat's theory about what the tokens mean and how the abstract writing developed from there. The passage does not say anything related to option E.
  Therefore, there is no evidence to support any but "none of the above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the abstract symbols used in the ancient cuneiform writing system.
  One of the abstract symbols discussed is the sign for "sheep".
  The author doesn't elaborate on the political life of the people who used this language.
  Also, the author does not suggest that other signs could be used instead of the sign for "sheep".
  However, the passage suggests that the sign for "sheep" is not a literal pictograph but as an abstract symbol.
  The author underscores the fact that the sign for "sheep" and "metal" are conveyed using different abstract symbols.
  The passage also suggests that the way in which the sign for "sheep" conveys meaning resulted from the fact that sheep was an agricultural commodity.
  Schmandt-Besserat's work on the system of tokens found in the archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers is mentioned.
  The tokens were identified as predecessor to the written word.
  So, the author would most likely agree with choice C which suggests that the way in which the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, rather than an image of a sheep.
  The author of the passage does not criticize nor contradict the use of the sign for "sheep", leaving no negative connotation in the text about the symbol.
  The passage only states a fact and does not give any specific information about the reasons why it was used that way.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author describes the sign for "sheep" as a circled cross, which is an abstract symbol 
  There is no indication that it could have been replaced by another sign without losing its significance
  The author compares the sign for "sheep" with the sign for "metal," both of which use abstract symbols.
  There is no emphasis on whether the sign represents sheep as an agricultural commodity or not.
  The author introduces Schmandt-Besserat as someone who gave scientific scrutiny to the tokens and their predecessors to the written word. However, there is no emphasis on the lack of scrutiny given to the sign for "sheep."
  There is no indication that the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep" reveals a great deal about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing.
  
  Therefore, the author of the passage would be most likely to agree with B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the abstract symbols used in cuneiform on the clay tablets.
  The sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, not an image of the animal itself.
  It is not described as being interchangeable with any other sign.
  There is no discussion of political life in relation to the symbol for "sheep".
  Schmandt-Besserat is mentioned, but only in relation to her research on the predecessors to the written word ("hundreds of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay").
  Therefore, the most likely statement would be that the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text describes the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep".
  The text states that the sign for "sheep" is a circled cross, which is different from a pictograph.
  The author might describe how the sign for "sheep" gets its meaning, or contrast it with the sign for "metal", or make a comparison between it and some other sign.
  The author does not talk about the political life of the people who used cuneiform writing.
  Answer choice D seems to be irrelevant to the discussion about the meaning of the sign for "sheep" and does not address how it was created. Therefore, it can be eliminated.
  Answer choices A, B, and E have unclear or inaccurate statements and can be eliminated.
  Answer choice C sounds reasonable, so it may be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that people's behavior is caused by their brain.
  Neuroscience changes the way we think about the law.
  Neuroscience and determinism combined suggest that people's behavior is not entirely under their control.
  The criminal-justice system should abandon retribution as a justification for punishment.
  
  Passage B argues that free actions are those that are not constrained by external causes.
  Ayer argued that actions from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free.
  The analogy could be made that the free will is not constrained by the brain.
  
  Both passages deal with the question of whether scientific research into the brain has implications regarding freedom of the will.
  The idea of determinism in neuroscience and the concept of free will are discussed in both passages.
  Both passages disagree with the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on the radical critics' views.
  The radical critics insisted that reality be depicted "as it is" and believed literature should be useful to serve a particular political view.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was more than the merely tangible, and reality was shaped by the person experiencing it.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
  The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky would be most softened if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality was different from the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky did not agree that reality should be depicted "as it is" since reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view was unsatisfactory to Dostoyevsky.
  The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy, acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works, or explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is. 
  Dostoyevsky defined artistic merit as the ability to write well and express his thoughts in characters and images so that the reader can fully understand the author's thoughts.
  Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals.
  Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works would be most softened for Dostoyevsky.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' demand that literature must be useful.
  He believed that art should not necessarily adhere to a particular political view.
  He thought that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  He defined "artistic" as the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts.
  Based on this information, if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, it would be in line with Dostoyevsky's views.
  Hence, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's beliefs regarding literature's purpose and the role of art in society.
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky believed that the task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of so-called reality and that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky thought that the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted as is was meaningless. Thus, it could be inferred that he would be most softened if the radical critics demonstrated that they understand the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Option B is the closest answer to the thought process but it implies that Dostoyevsky values clarity of purpose, whereas the passage indicates that he values writing well. 
  Option D, on the other hand, closely aligns with the author's view on the importance of artistic merit in literature.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' requirement that art must always serve a particular political view. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that art should stand or fall on its artistic merit. 
  He believed artistic merit to be the ability to write well and express the author's thoughts in characters and images so that readers could understand them. 
  Therefore, the answer should be a choice that helps radical critics understand the importance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 
  Choice D directly matches these criteria by acknowledging the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's attitude toward radical critics.
  It states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the person who experienced reality shaped it, and furthermore, reality was necessarily subjective to the one experiencing it.
  The author suggests that Dostoyevsky would soften to the radical critics' views if they were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains Dostoyevsky's view on two directions in Russian literary criticism, one of which is radical and maintains that art should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky's view of reality in literature is different from the radical critics as well as from the other direction in Russian literary criticism.
  Dostoevsky believes that the task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts.
  Dostoevsky believes that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  Therefore, the choice that would be most softened by Dostoevsky is the one that recognizes the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics' view of the role of literature.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' view that art must serve a particular political view.
  Dostoyevsky argued that literature must serve artistic merit, defined as "the ability to write well."
  The passage does not indicate that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if radical critics changed their view on reality and fantasy.
  The passage does not indicate that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if radical critics acknowledged the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works.
  The passage indicates that Dostoyevsky considered artistic merit to be crucial in evaluating literary works. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's opinion about the literary criticism of his time.
  Dostoyevsky's view of reality went beyond the prevailing view of reality among radical critics.
  He believed that reality included fantasy, that reality was shaped by the individual, and that reality was more than the tangible.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, not based on its usefulness or political view.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how the novel "Jazz" by Toni Morrison uses music as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  The narration of the novel is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solos' performances.
  The narrator allows the central characters to speak while still exerting control over the narrative as a whole. 
  The characters' sections are set off with quotation marks which are reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.
  The narrator creates the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, which is similar to how Duke Ellington construct his compositions with individual musicians and their unique voices in mind.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 is most called into question if it is not true that Toni Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. 
  None of the other answer choices properly challenge this assertion. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author asserts that none have tried to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel, until Toni Morrison's Jazz.
  Therefore, choices A, B, C, and E are not valid because they are either incorrect or not related to the author's assertion.
  Choice D says that depending on whether or not a novel is read aloud it can be found to be musical in nature, but this is not related to Morrison's work or the author's assertion.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  The structure of Jazz has a relationship to the structure of jazz music.
  Jazz is unique in its style of narration.
  The assertion is about African American writers.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be A, D or E.
  The passage is about Jazz and does not discuss the structure of other novels.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage talks about Toni Morrison's novel Jazz.
  In Jazz, Toni Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  This is analogous to the ensemble sound of jazz and the individuality of embedded solo performances within the fixed scope of the composition constructed by the composer.
  The author claims that none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
  Therefore, if someone attempted to make a novel that simulates a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story, it would contradict the author's assertion.
  The answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The paragraph talks about how literature and music influence each other, especially in African American tradition.
  Toni Morrison wrote Jazz with the structuring principle based on a musical genre.
  The narration style in Jazz is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz band, with individual character voices and a collective narration.
  Lines 11-16 seem to be discussing how Toni Morrison drew upon a musical genre as the structuring principle of her novel.
  Answer choice A supports the idea that the narration style was deliberately intended to simulate a style of jazz performance.
  The other answer choices either do not answer the question or are not mentioned in the given context.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question is asking about the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
  These lines talk about how Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is unique in being structured according to a musical genre.
  None of the choices completely match this assertion.
  Choice A comes closest, but it adds the detail that the author intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance, which is more than what the passage explicitly says.
  Choice B mentions the blues, which is a different musical genre than jazz.
  Choice C is too broad and absolute in its statement.
  Choice D talks about music in novels in general, but the question is asking specifically about Jazz.
  Choice E is the opposite of what the passage says, as the passage asserts that many African American writers have used music as a theme or metaphor, but only Toni Morrison structured an entire novel according to a musical genre.
  Therefore, the best answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage talks about Toni Morrison and her novel Jazz, discussing how she used the structure of jazz music in the narration of the story.

  The question is asking what the author's assertion would be most called into question if one of the answer choices were true.
  Answer A restates and reinforces the author's assertion, so it would not be called into question if it were true.
  Answer B refers to the blues, not jazz, and it does not challenge or relate to the author's assertion.
  Answer C is too broad of a statement and does not relate to the author's assertion.
  Answer D is also too broad and does not relate to the author's assertion.
  Answer E is unrelated to the author's assertion and provides no evidence that would cause it to be called into question.
  Since none of the answer choices provide evidence that contradicts the author's assertion, the correct answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage talks about Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how the structure is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand, in which individual performances are embedded in an ensemble sound. The lines in question refer to the fact that "Jazz" is the first novel to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel, by simulating the style of a genius of music. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author states that Toni Morrison used the structuring principle of a musical genre for her entire novel Jazz.
  The musical genre she drew upon is jazz, a form of art that intertwines ensemble sound with individual solo performances.
  Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind, and his musicians always performed within his frame.
  Morrison's novel Jazz creates the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within a carefully constructed collective narration, by simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if choice B, C, D, or E were true, as they do not provide evidence that Toni Morrison used jazz as the structuring principle for her entire novel. 
  Answer A, on the other hand, supports the author's claim that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage starts by describing the debate about deterrence methods for certain types of crime.
  Then, two opposing views are presented regarding the reasons why deliberate crimes are committed.
  The passage talks about a recent development that reconciles the two positions by using an economic principle.
  The economic principle is then explained, showing how it works to analyze the rationality of an individual when committing a crime.
  Finally, the passage uses this framework to show that the two deterrence methods are complementary.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes two sides of a debate in regards to deterring crimes.
  The debate is whether deliberate crimes are influenced by societal norms and institutions or an individual's choice.
  The passage introduces an economic principle to show that these two positions are not fundamentally in conflict.
  The focus of the passage seems to be centered around this economic principle.
  Based on this analysis, choice B seems to be the best answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage presents two opposing views on deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  The two views are about societal influences on crime vs individual choice.
  The passage introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, which shows how the two views can be complementary.
  The passage concludes that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include both societal influences and individual choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage first describes two sides of a debate on the effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side believes in societal change and rehabilitation, while the other side believes in severe punishment and efficacious law enforcement.
  Some scholars reconcile these two positions using the economic principle of utility maximization.
  The principle explains how an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The principle also shows that the two sides of the debate are complementary, not antithetical to each other.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is most accurately described as using an economic principle to reconcile two sides of a debate.
  The answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage first presents two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  Then it introduces an economic principle that reconciles the two positions and shows how the two methods can be complementary.
  The passage goes on to explain how the two methods can affect the utility equation.
  Therefore, the main organization of the passage is to present two sides of a debate and apply an economic principle to reconcile them.
  The two sides of the debate were "those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals" and "legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice."
  The economic principle introduced to reconcile the two positions is utility maximization.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses a problem being debated by legal scholars about the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Two sides of the debate are described, one suggesting changes in societal norms and institutions and rehabilitation, and the other suggesting increased fines and penalties along with efficacious law enforcement.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile the two positions by demonstrating how both strategies work to deter crime.
  The principle was used to demonstrate that both methods are complementary and a combined approach would be optimal.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is best described by answer choice A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage is about the debate on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  Two sides of the debate are presented.
  The economic principle of utility maximization is introduced to reconcile the two positions and demonstrate that both sides are complementary.
  The answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: The passage describes a debate between two sides, one believing that changing societal norms and institutions is the best way to deter deliberate crimes, and the other believing that increased fines and penalties is the best method. The passage introduces an economic principle, utility maximization, to reconcile these two positions as complementary. The passage explains how each position affects the utility equation and lowers the likelihood of committing deliberate crimes. The passage concludes that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage presents two sides of a debate on deterring deliberate crimes.
  One side believes it's a product of societal norms and suggests changing beliefs about crime, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating convicts.
  The other side believes it's a result of individual choice and suggests larger fines and penalties, along with better law enforcement.
  Recent legal scholarship suggests that the utility maximization principle reconciles the two positions.
  The utility maximization principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  This principle can be applied to both sides of the debate, and both methods effectively lower the expected utility from criminal activity.
  Thus, the best approach would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  The passage is organized in a way that presents two sides of a debate, introduces an economic principle, and reconciles the two positions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes a debate between two sides on the most effective way to deter crimes.
  The principle of utility maximization is introduced as a way to reconcile the two positions and demonstrate that they are complementary.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary is often misguided, and regulatory policy should aim to save as many lives as possible.
  The author also argues that judgments about voluntariness often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  The author does not express a view as to whether skydiving serves any socially useful purpose.
  The author argues that notions of voluntariness should not be used to determine regulatory policy.
  The author argues that the voluntariness of a risk is rarely an all-or-nothing matter but one of degree.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between "voluntary" and "involuntary" risk may not be a good basis for policy decisions.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The author also suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  None of the choices fully captures the author's argument, but Option D comes close.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage talks about judgments of voluntary and involuntary risks and argues that it's not a good way to shape policy. 
Choice A: The author argues that judgments on voluntary and involuntary risks are not enough to guide policy decisions, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a stance on skydiving. The argument is that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underline judgments about voluntariness. 
Choice B: The passage states that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake whereas laypeople care more about whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. It doesn't indicate that policy experts see the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly as irrelevant. 
Choice C: The passage doesn't provide information about the comparative probabilities of different types of risks that airplane passengers face. Moreover, the author provides examples of how judgments about risks stem from antecedent judgments of some other kind. 
Choice D: The passage presents a critique of the notion of judgments of voluntary and involuntary risks. The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the main source of difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. The author states that the notion of voluntariness is not a good guide for regulatory policy. Instead, it should be replaced by a better understanding of the factors that lead to judgments about voluntariness. Thus, D is the correct choice. 
Choice E: The passage argues against judgments of voluntary and involuntary risks, but doesn't provide information to support the notion that natural disasters are the main source of completely involuntary risks.  

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is of little use in guiding policy decisions.
  The author also argues that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, regardless of whether the risk is voluntary or involuntary.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the government should protect people against risks regardless of voluntariness, and weigh the cost-benefit of the policy decision.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that judgments about whether risks are "involuntary" are of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  The passage recommends that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  It is implied that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  The answer is not A, B, C or E, but D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. This statement matches with the author's approach to a better understanding of risk judgments. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that some risks are voluntary while others are not.
  Presidential experts tend to focus on the number of lives at risk while laypeople care about whether a risk is voluntary.
  Voluntariness of risk is not a binary matter.
  People often characterize any risk as voluntary when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risk.
  Regulatory policy should be guided by identifying specific considerations.
  Skydiving is used as an example of a risky activity that serves no socially useful purpose.
  The purpose of the passage is to argue that regulatory policy should be guided not by the notion of voluntariness but by the identification of specific considerations.
  Therefore, A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose is more likely to contradict the author's argument.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety is not a central point discussed in the paragraph.
  C: There is no mention of this in the passage.
  D: This statement is close to the idea of voluntariness that the author is describing.
  E: There is a mention of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, which is an example of a risk that is involuntary but there is no mention of natural disasters being the main category of risk that is completely involuntarily incurred.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention and the risk of something is voluntary when the people have control over whether to take the risk. 
The author argues that people should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
Therefore, the author is most likely to agree with the statement that matches their perspective.
A: disagrees with the author's perspective as the author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. However, it is argued that risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
B: contradicts the author's perspective as the author argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake and laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. The author does not argue whether the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would be deemed irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
C: The author does not present any statistics or comparison on risks associated with plane crashes and other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers. Hence, C is not the correct answer.
D: The author argues that a risk should be deemed voluntary if the people have control over whether to take the risk. Therefore, D matches the perspective of the author.
E: This statement contradicts the author's argument as the author argues that although volunatriness may be entirely absent in some risks, such as an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Hence, E is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The author argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary," and departures from the principle of maximizing the number of saved lives should be justified through specific considerations, not by invoking the concepts of voluntariness.
(A) The author mentions "socially useful purpose" as a factor that influences laypeople's judgments about risk, but they do not provide a clear stance on whether skydiving should be regulated or prohibited.
(B) The passage mentions that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake and that laypeople distinguish between voluntary and involuntary risks, which may affect perceptions of risk in air travel. However, the author does not provide a clear stance on whether people's choice to fly is relevant to decisions about government regulation.
(C) The passage does not provide information that would allow us to compare the probability of occurrence and death or injury for plane crashes and other risks.
(D) The passage suggests that it is not easy to determine whether a risk is voluntarily incurred and that people's judgments about voluntariness may be influenced by factors other than the decision to undertake a risk. The author argues that voluntariness is not a useful criterion for guiding regulatory policy, so it is unlikely that they would endorse the statement that risks should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to them unless they make a particular choice.
(E) The author briefly mentions "unforeseeable collision with an asteroid" as an example of a risk that is incurred involuntarily, but they do not discuss natural disasters as a category of risk, let alone the main one incurred involuntarily.
Therefore, the best answer is (D): For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The author argues that judgments about whether risks are "voluntary" or "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  The author argues that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  None of the choices directly match the author's argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author suggests that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. 
  People often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks.
  There is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary."
  Regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. 
  Therefore, regulatory policy should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety seems to align with the author's point.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?
Choices:
  A: Researchers' prospects for academic advancement depend on both the quality and the quantity of their research.
  B: Researchers' funding is often contingent on whether they can produce a patentable product.
  C: Researchers see no incompatibility between unfettered basic research and the granting of biotechnology patents.
  D: Researchers increasingly believe their intellectual labor is being unfairly exploited by universities that partner with for-profit corporations.
  E: Most researchers prefer a competitive model of scientific research to a communal model.
Response 0:

Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that CFCs released into the lower atmosphere slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere.
  In the stratosphere, under the influence of ultraviolet radiation, CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The resulting increase in chlorine concentration in the stratosphere is detrimental to the ozone layer.
  The ozone depletion would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately.
  Consequently, this led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  Therefore, Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. This statement is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains that ultraviolet light is a contributing factor to skin cancer.
  It also says that the ozone layer protects the earth from most of the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage explains that CFCs are chemicals that can deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer makes the earth less protected from ultraviolet radiation, which could lead to increased skin cancer rates.
  Since CFCs, when broken down in the stratosphere, lead to increases in chlorine concentrations, and chlorine and ozone react chemically to destroy ozone and regenerate the chlorine, we could say that most ozone destruction occurs in the presence of chlorine, so A is not a strongly supported statement.
  While B is true, it's not the most strongly supported statement in the passage.
  The passage states that CFCs are not the only chemicals that can release chlorine in the upper atmosphere, so C is not a strongly supported statement.
  The passage confirms that limiting the use of CFCs leads to lower ozone depletion, which in turn lowers the incidence of skin cancer, so D is a strongly supported statement.
  Finally, Antarctica is only mentioned in relation to confirming the views of Molina and Rowland, so E is not the most strongly supported statement in the passage.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes how CFCs cause the depletion of the ozone layer by releasing chlorine into the upper atmosphere.
  Chlorine in the stratosphere leads to chemical reactions with ozone that destroy the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer contributes to an increase in ultraviolet radiation which leads to an increase in skin cancer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can indirectly lower the incidence of skin cancer.
  The most strongly supported statement among the choices is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how manufactured CFCs are responsible for attacking and reducing the effectiveness of the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
  The destruction caused by CFCs leads to an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere, which, when combined with ozone, both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  This chemical reaction releases free chlorine, which then becomes active in further breaking down ozone in the environment.
  The depletion of the ozone layer allows for the sun's ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the earth's surface, contributing to skin cancer.
  The passage does not provide conclusive evidence to support the selection of choices B, C, or E.
  However, the passage does state that depletion of the ozone layer is the cause of skin cancer.
  Therefore, the best answer choice is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that the ozone layer acts as a shield against ultraviolet radiation, which causes skin cancer.
  The passage also mentioned that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  This means that regulating the use of CFCs could contribute to reducing the depletion of the ozone layer, therefore, decreasing the incidence of skin cancer.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the information in the passage is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the stratospheric ozone is a shield against the sun's ultraviolet radiation.
  The passage also states that Molina and Rowland showed that CFCs chemically attacked and destroyed the ozone layer by releasing chlorine which destroyed ozone molecules.
  Molina and Rowland's advocacy led to the banning of CFCs under the Montreal Protocol of 1987.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancers as CFCs destroy the ozone layer that protects against ultraviolet radiation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the damage caused by the release of CFCs.
  Molina and Rowland showed how the release of CFCs into the atmosphere caused the destruction of the ozone layer.
  The destruction of the ozone layer results from the rise in concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Public policy changes regarding the use of CFCs eventually led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987 to ban the production of ozone-depletinggases.
  Therefore, regulated use of CFCs can potentially lead to the renewal and preservation of the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the depletion of the ozone layer occurs due to manufactured CFCs.
  The CFCs contain chlorine.
  Once the CFCs reach the stratosphere they are exposed to massive ultraviolet radiation, depleting the ozone layer and releasing the chlorine.
  Due to a chemical reaction, one chlorine atom can destroy up to 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Therefore, the use of CFCs and the subsequent release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere is the primary cause of ozone layer destruction.
  Therefore, option A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present is the most strongly supported statement by the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the role of CFCs in depleting the ozone layer of the atmosphere, thus reducing its effectiveness as a barrier against ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
  Chlorine compounds in CFCs react chemically with ozone, destroying it and regenerating the chlorine to continue the reaction.
  The depletion of ozone layers due to human-made CFCs would continue even after the cessation of the use of those CFCs.
  Without the ozone layer's protection, ultraviolet light from the sun can cause skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
In the passage, the two scientists proposed that the CFCs in the troposphere release chlorine to the stratosphere, which chemically reacts with the ozone molecules to destroy them and regenerate the chlorine. The passage also explains that this process could destroy 100,000 ozone molecules before chlorine becomes inactive. Additionally, the passage mentions that the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica corroborated their views, leading to the development of an international agreement, the Montreal Protocol of 1987, to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs.
Action: Answer("D")   
The statement that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage is "Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer." because the passage explains that CFCs, when released into the stratosphere, chemically react with the ozone layer and deplete it, reducing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. The consequence is skin cancer, which is acknowledged as sun-obtained and related to radiation.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

  The second paragraph presents the argument that Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced by elites that mirror their ideals and way of life.
  The third paragraph discusses the two social classes that were able to commission art and notes that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce enduring art.
  The third paragraph also discusses how some great artists were engaged by rich patrons with eccentric tastes and how some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The third paragraph introduces the two social classes that were able to commission art - the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, which used to be called the bourgeoisie.
  The paragraph also notes that the taste of these classes of society has not always produced art that endures.
  The author mentions that the more talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment to get their work commissioned or had to have their work commissioned unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Finally, the paragraph concludes that the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analysis to claim that art that went against the grain of elite values embodied the ideals of the elite.
Action: Answer("B")  
The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph starts by introducing two social classes that could commission art: the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
  The paragraph then refers to Matthew Arnold's identification of the aristocracy and the middle class as "Barbarians" and "Philistines," respectively, in the characterization of nineteenth-century English culture.
  The paragraph points out that some of the most talented artists often had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  And finally, the paragraph highlights that because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  The paragraph's primary function is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The third paragraph starts with "Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class".
  This statement assumes that there were only two classes in the history of art that could commission art.
  The author then discusses how the taste of these two classes did not always produce enduring art.
  The paragraph then claims that talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment due to the narrow tastes of the wealthy.
  Lastly, the author argues that some art that goes against the grain of the elite's values endures and thus opposes the idea that the sociohistorical criticism solely relies on the work commissioned by the elite.
  The primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The third paragraph starts by discussing how sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, and it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity to analyze such art. It further explores how historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class. 
  Then the paragraph discusses how their taste may not be apt to produce an art that endures and how the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment. 
  Finally, it discusses how a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and how the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The third paragraph examines the two social classes that were able to commission art.
  The examination helps to qualify and challenge the idea of the aristocracy and the upper middle class having the best taste in art.
  The examination concludes that some of the most talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and some of the art went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The paragraph doesn't reject a response to the argument made in the first paragraph, nor does it present an argument that weakens or offer additional evidence for the conclusion reached in the second paragraph.
  The paragraph identifies assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph, and those assumptions include the recognition of an elite identity and consensus and the elimination of the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The third paragraph begins by discussing how the tastes of the aristocracy and the upper middle class do not always produce great art.
  The author then mentions how more talented artists have to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  The author also brings up the point that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The purpose of the third paragraph is not to reject an argument from the first paragraph or to draw a definitive conclusion.
  The third paragraph is instead strengthening the sociohistorical critic's argument from the second paragraph by pointing out how not all art was produced for the purpose of reflecting the elite's ideals, and how some artists may have subverted those ideals.
  The paragraph identifies assumptions about the relationship between artists and patrons on the construction of art and how the dynamics of that relationship may influence the creation of art.
  Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The third paragraph starts with the sentence, "sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way," which shows a reference to the argument made in the second paragraph.
  The paragraph discusses the taste of aristocracy and the upper middle class that are not always apt to produce an art that endures.
  The author mentions that more talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, and some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by them unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The entire paragraph highlights the assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  Therefore, the answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

  The author criticizes the taste of these social classes, calling the aristocracy 'Barbarians' and the middle class 'Philistines.'
  The author suggests that these social classes were not always apt to produce art that endures, and that more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, engaging with a rich patron with eccentric tastes.
  The author also suggests that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for unwillingly and with misgivings, but because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the primary function of the third paragraph is to identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.
  The answer is B: identify assumptions relied upon by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph introduces additional information regarding the elite's taste in art.
  The first sentence suggests that the information provides clarification or correction to the argument made in the previous paragraphs.
  The rest of the paragraph seems to discuss how artists sometimes had to find ways to create art outside of the establishment's tastes and how some art went against the elite's values.
  None of the choices seem to match what the third paragraph is trying to accomplish.
  However, the closest match seems to be B because it does discuss assumptions made by a type of analysis referred to in the first paragraph.

Response 1:
Thought: 
  The statement about Raphael's frescoes comes after the author discusses the two ways that art has historically been produced and commissioned by elites. This suggests that the example is relevant to understanding the author's argument about the differences between these methods.
  The example is not used to discuss the influence of religion on art, or to show how an artist can subvert the ideals of the patron.
  Choice C is close, but the author does not claim that Raphael's frescoes are the most common type of relationship between a patron and an artist, making it an incomplete or incorrect answer choice.
  Since the example is tied to the author's argument about sociohistorical interpretations of art and the way elites commissioned and valued art, and how it was analyzed subsequently, choice A is the best answer. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The paragraph discusses two different ways in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The frescoes painted in Vatican apartments by Raphael were commissioned by Pope Julius II, which suggests that it was produced by and for the governing class.

Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

  The information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 is discussing a lawyer's duty when they are convinced that their clients are guilty.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 is reporting the opinion of some legal scholars that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, regardless of their belief in the client's guilt or innocence.
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 extend the argument presented in lines 7-11 regarding the lawyer's role, but discussing the situational specifics and limitations of the lawyer's obligation to the client, court, and society.
  Therefore, the relationship between these two sets of statements can be described as agreement in general with the earlier position, but disagreement over the specific circumstances.
  The best answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 talk about how lawyers who are convinced of their clients' guilt should present their client's case in a favorable way while also keeping in mind the facts of the case.
  The sentences at lines 7-11 argue that defense lawyers' responsibility is to provide the best defense they are capable of, regardless of whether they believe their clients are innocent or guilty.
  There seems to be a disagreement between the two positions, since the sentences at lines 28-31 seem to indicate that lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false, even if their client is guilty.
  Therefore, the answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The two sentences at lines 28-31 talk about guilty defendants and how defense lawyers should proceed in such situations.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about the obligations of defense attorneys, and how some legal scholars view those obligations.
  The last sentence of the passage explains that the best defense can only be provided by a lawyer who carefully analyzes the facts and believes in the client's case.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentences at lines 28-31 further explain how a defense lawyer should act in cases where the lawyer knows the defendant is guilty. The sentences elaborate on the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society, which is mentioned briefly in the earlier lines.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss the obligation of lawyers to their clients, the court, and society.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses whether it is necessary for defense lawyers to believe that their clients are innocent.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 clarify the obligations of defense lawyers.
  The clarification is intended to show that the obligations of lawyers can sometimes conflict with each other.
  So the sentences at lines 28-31 offer a more complete picture of the issue presented in the sentence at lines 7-11.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is that it offers a more complete picture or clarification of the issue presented in the sentence at lines 7–11.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about whether defense lawyers must believe that their clients are innocent of the charges against them.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 talk about the obligations of lawyers to present to the court assertions that they know to be true and to argue for any degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
  There is a close relationship between these two ideas.
  The author argues that a lawyer should not deny a defendant's guilt if they know with certainty that their client is guilty.
  Rather, they should present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
  This view supports the idea that lawyers have an obligation to present to the court assertions that they know to be true, which is discussed in the sentences at lines 28-31.
  Therefore, the relationship between the sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 is that the former supports the argument made in the latter.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense they can to their clients.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss how defense lawyers should handle a case in which they know with certainty that their clients are guilty.
  The second set of sentences begins by stating that, although the defense lawyer's obligation is to the defendant, their obligation to the court and by extension to society is no less important.
  The second set of sentences elaborates on the defense lawyer's obligation and provides guidance for handling cases in which the lawyer knows with certainty that their clients are guilty.
  Therefore, the relationship of the sentences at lines 28-31 to that in the sentence at lines 7-11 is elaboration and clarification of the defense lawyer's obligation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Lines 7-11 explain that some legal scholars believe that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts.
  Lines 28-31 state an opinion that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The opinion in lines 28-31 supports the earlier position in the sense that the responsibility of the defense lawyer is twofold.
  Lines 28-31 propose the idea of not presenting false assertions to the court, which aligns with the principle that lawyers should not provide insincere representation to guilty defendants.
  So there is a connection between the earlier and the later reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")				     
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 talks about guilty defendants and the duty of lawyers if they know that their clients are guilty.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about the obligation of lawyers to give the best defense they are capable of providing. 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 introduces a condition under which the lawyers' responsibility to the court should take precedence over their sole obligation to provide the best defense to their client.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 qualifies how the obligation of lawyers to provide the best defense they are capable of is limited by ethical considerations.
  There is a relationship between the information in the two sentences because the sentence at lines 28-31 specifies an exception to the sentence at lines 7-11.
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that if defense lawyers are convinced that their clients are guilty, they must not try to demonstrate their innocence.
  The earlier lines state that the lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, and they should not express or act on personal opinions but act as advocates.
  While the earlier lines mention that lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false, at no point does it mention that lawyers should try to prove or disprove the innocence of their clients.
  Therefore, the sentences at lines 28-31 are not in agreement with the earlier position but instead contradict it.
  The answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  According to the passage, FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain for the task being performed after subtracting out the oxygen consumption for a baseline measurement.
  The reason behind the use of these scans is flawed, and does not fully account for the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for the option that is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  Among the given choices, option B deals with the same type of logic, where something is misinterpreted based on a precise condition being met.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage compares FMRI with a subtraction, in which a baseline measurement is subtracted from a cognitive task measurement. 
  The method is used to depict areas of the brain that are active in response to a particular cognitive task. 
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with that cognitive task.
  However, the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
  Therefore, we can look for an option that describes the phenomenon in which a smaller part of a given entity is given credit for the entire outcome.
  Option A talks about one particular district in a city being responsible for a mayoral win.
  Option B describes an advertisement campaign that affected only summer shoppers.
  Option C describes the use of water by the agricultural sector in drought situations.
  Option D says most of the Internet traffic during evening hours originates from homes. 
  Option E explains how cheetahs are the worlds fastest animal over short distances; however, most cheetahs cannot outrun another animal in the long run.
  The most analogous option is option B because in this option, an advertising campaign is credited as the cause of increased shoppers, even though the increase was seasonal. So, the entire advertising campaign was given the credit, while in the summer season, the increase in shoppers happened due to various other factors like summer holidays, etc.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  According to the context, FMRI scans show the difference in the metabolic activity of the brain in two scenarios.
  This means that what we are seeing is the difference in the activity rather than the absolute functional localization.
  A and D are not analogous as they do not show the difference or the relative activity.
  E is not analogous because it talks about a categorical difference between short and long distances rather than relative utilization.
  C is not analogous as it talks about usage rather than the differential utilization in two different conditions.
  B is the most appropriate analogy as it shows "an increase in shoppers ONLY during the summer" and explicitly states that the advertisements "AFFECTED only the summer shoppers", which is analogous to the fact that FMRI shows the difference in brain activity ONLY during a cognitive task.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the method by which FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans measure the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain while a subject performs a cognitive task, subtracting a baseline measurement in a control condition from the cognitive condition to produce an image of the metabolic activity associated solely with the task.
  The method picks out a set of specific metabolic processes as the substrate of cognition, while neglecting the distributed metabolic activity that characterizes the brain's functioning more generally.
  In the choice options, (A) describes the importance of a certain district, but it does not involve subtracting a baseline to isolate any unique attribute.
  (B) describes a causal relationship between a yearlong ad campaign and its effect on summer shoppers, but it does not involve isolating specific traits
  (C) describes a quantitative difference, with agricultural customers using more water than residential customers, but it does not involve subtracting a baseline.
  (D) describes a time-based statistical analysis for the source of internet traffic, but it does not involve subtracting a baseline to isolate a unique aspect of any condition.
  (E) describes the limitation on the cheetah's speed, but it does not involve subtracting a baseline to isolate any specific metabolic process.
  Therefore, all the answer choices are not analogous to interpreting FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question is asking to find a situation analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity described in the passage.
  According to the passage, in FMRI scans, a baseline measurement is taken first and then a second reading is taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task, and the two measurements are subtracted to show the specific neurons that light up in response to some cognitive activities.
  The issue is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and this method presents a false impression of neat functions.
  Among the choices, the example that is most analogous to the FMRI scan is the one where an advertising campaign was launched for a year, but it only led to an increase in shoppers during the summer. This is because just like how the advertising campaigns can only impact those who shop during the summer, the FMRI scans can only pick up specific limited cognitive activity that occurs during the task at hand, while ignoring the entire brain's activity. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity.
  The scans are interpreted using a subtraction method that produces a map of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The method works by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The resulting image is supposed to represent the metabolic activity solely associated with the cognitive task.
  However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Answer (D) gives an example of how a particular phenomenon (Internet traffic) is most pronounced during a particular time period (evening hours), so it can be inferred that most of this traffic originates from a particular location (homes). 
  This is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because the subtraction method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which creates a false impression of neat functional localization. Just as the fact that Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours does not mean that most Internet traffic originates from homes, the fact that a particular area of the brain "lights up" during a cognitive task does not necessarily mean that this area is solely responsible for the cognitive function in question. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted as a subtraction method.
  In FMRI, a baseline measurement is taken while the subject is at rest, and a second measurement is taken while the subject performs a cognitive task.
  The baseline is then subtracted from the on-task measurement to identify the areas of brain activation associated with the cognitive task.
  The subtractive method hides the fact that the entire brain is active in both the conditions.
  Therefore, the given scenario should also involve a situation where one thing is subtracted from another to get a specific outcome.
  Option B talks about how an advertisement campaign affected only summer shoppers and not others.
  So, option B is the best analogy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes that the FMRI scans of brain activity are based on the subtraction of two measurements.
  One measurement is taken in the control condition, and the other when the subject performs some cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to obtain the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The entire brain is active in both conditions, and the method obscures the fact that the brain functions distributed throughout.
  The question asks for the most word analogous.
  Based on the contextual information, choice (B) could be the most analogous, talking about a situation where only summer shoppers were affected by the store's advertisement campaign, even though the campaign lasted a whole year.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The FMRI scans of brain activity depend on a subtraction method.
  This method subtracts the baseline measurement taken in a control condition from the on-task measurements while doing a cognitive task.
  The remaining activity in the brain after this subtraction is thought to be associated solely with the cognitive task.
  This method gives a false impression of the brain's neat functional localization by obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district. - Not analogous.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. - Not analogous.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur. - Not analogous.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. - Not analogous.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. - Not analogous.
  The manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about how brain scans are complex research methods to analyze mental activity, and the validity of which depends on a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. 
  When a functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is scanned, what you are seeing is actually the result of a subtraction.
  Therefore, I need to find an option that describes a scenario where one needs to subtract one condition from another to interpret the result.
  Option A talks about how one particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district. But this option doesn't involve the subtraction of one condition from another condition for interpretation.
  Option B talks about a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. But this option doesn't involve the subtraction of one condition from another condition for interpretation.
  Option C talks about how much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur. But this option doesn't involve the subtraction of one condition from another condition for interpretation.
  Option D talks about how Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings. But this option doesn't involve the subtraction of one condition from another condition for interpretation.
  Option E talks about how the cheetah is the world's fastest land animal, but only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. But this option doesn't involve the subtraction of one condition from another condition for interpretation.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The objection in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. The objection suggests that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first in cultural chauvinism and is not the way to genuinely understand non-Western cultures. 
  The question is asking which statement critics who raised this objection would most likely agree with.
  Option A is partly true; the perspective of different values and circumstances can affect understanding and interpretation of other cultures. Nevertheless, this option does not directly address the critics' concerns, so it's not the correct answer.
  Option B is true, but it is a general proposition and not specific to the issue at hand.
  Option C is a reasonable statement, but it is not directly related to the issue that critics are concerned about.
  Option D contradicts the main point of the text, which is that multicultural education should not use the cultural values of one culture as standards to judge others.
  Option E is the most relevant to the critics' concerns. It states that using scientific methods alone isn't sufficient to understand cultures and cultural values and requires non-scientific methods.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  This paragraph discusses the second objection to the second version of multicultural education. 
  This objection argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and that adopting these methods to understand non-scientific cultures is distorting.
  This objection advocates adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve real understanding.
  Therefore, the objection is likely to agree with the idea that "The social and historical circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values."
  Choice B directly matches this idea.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph is that the second version of multicultural education, like the first, is still not different since it still follows the (often) Western scientific perspective, which is already value-laden, and therefore distorts the understanding of non-Western cultures.
The objection does not suggest that understanding the social and historical circumstances of a culture with different values is impossible.
Option B, which states that historical and social circumstances play an important role in developing a culture's values, is enough to explain that understanding non-western cultures through western scientific methods is not adequate.
Option A is incorrect.
Option C is not correct since the objection does not talk about cultural perspectives but rather the methods of examining other cultures.
Option D is also incorrect because the objection does not imply that a shared cultural value is a prerequisite for genuine understanding.
Option E is also incorrect because the objection does not talk about the adequacy of understanding liberal values. 
Therefore, the answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
 The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that real understanding of non-Western cultures can only be achieved by adopting their perspectives and methods.
 This implies that scientific discourse, which is often an expression of Western culture, is not enough to achieve real understanding.
Choice E suggests that liberalism, a Western value, cannot be understood through Western science only, which aligns with the objection discussed in the paragraph.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The critics discussed in the second paragraph hold that non-western cultures cannot be understood by the methods of Western science.
  They argue that the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology are already value laden and thus are not essentially different from the first proposal.
  They maintain that it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the studied cultures that real understanding can be achieved.
  Among the answer choices, the one that appears to align with the critics' argument is E:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that understanding other cultures through the methods of Western science is an expression of cultural chauvinism.
The second version of multicultural education involves adopting the methods of Anthropology, Political Science, Sociology, and Social Psychology, which are Western methods.
The critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that to understand other cultures, we should adopt the perspectives and methods of those cultures.
This indicates that the critics would support the idea of the historical and social circumstances of a culture playing an essential role in the development of the culture's values.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The critics in the second paragraph raise an objection that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if they are studied solely through the methods of Western science. They believe that to understand a culture, one must adopt the perspectives and methods of that culture. 
Option E aligns with the critics' objection and states that values of liberalism cannot be fully understood if studied only through Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The paragraph discusses a criticism of the second proposal of multicultural education that argues its methods come from a Western scientific perspective and do not allow for understanding of other cultures on their own terms.
The critics of the second version of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage prizes the empirically verifiable over the mystical and has values such as objectivity that can be distorting and maintaining a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
The passage does not suggest anything about the cultural values of liberals, nor the necessity of different cultural perspectives.
Therefore, choices A, C, D, and E can be eliminated.
The passage does mention that critics believe that understanding other cultures depends on their own terms rather than only through the majority culture's perspective.
The second version of multicultural education attempts to take a neutral stance with respect to the values of other cultures but adopts Western scientific methods to understand them. Critics believe that even scientific methods are value-laden and Eurocentric and that understanding can be provided only by adopting non-scientific perspectives and methods from the cultures studied.
Therefore, the critics of the second proposal discussed in the second paragraph would likely agree with option B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

The objection discussed in the second paragraph is saying that the Western scientific methods used to study non-Western cultures are value-laden, and may not allow genuine understanding of those cultures.
The objection suggests that adopting non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures studied may allow real understanding instead. 
None of the answers mention the use of scientific methods as a barrier to understanding other cultures, except E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Critics argue that not all cultures share liberal values, and thus, cannot be properly understood if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. 
Therefore, the critics would be most likely to agree with the idea that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

Thought: 
  The passage is discussing the relationship between plants and plant-eating insects.
  It discusses the chemical composition of plants and how secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The passage notes that some secondary substances attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others serve as defenses against plant-eating insects.
  The evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects ultimately led to the narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants.
  The paragraph concludes by discussing how plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, and how this process has led to a continuing competition between plants and plant-eating insects.
  The main point of the passage is that the evolution of secondary substances in plants has been shaped by interactions with plant-eating insects over hundreds of millions of years.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The passage describes plants and their chemical composition with respect to insects.
The secondary substances have no role in the plant's internal chemical processes, but play a role in defense against and interaction with insects.
The passage indicates that this is due to a competition that has been happening for hundreds of millions of years between plants and insects, which has led to an evolution of the secondary substances.
Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells present in modern-day plants, are a result of an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses primary and secondary substances in plants.
  Secondary substances provide distinct tastes and smells that often act as a defense mechanism.
  Insects have a major role to play in the development of these substances by natural selection.
  There is an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects.
  This competition has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances and the insect species that eat each species of plant.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants and the distinctive tastes and smells, result from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage talks about two categories of chemical substances in plants; primary and secondary. It further explains that the secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no role in plant growth or metabolism but are responsible for distinctive tastes and smells. It explains that insects played a major role in plants having their current secondary substances. The passage goes on to describe why and how certain secondary substances were favored by natural selection and hence conserved in subsequent generations (either as scents that attract pollinating insects or as biochemical defenses). It then describes how insects evolved to circumvent plant defenses, and how as the competition between plants and insects progressed over millions of years, fewer plants remained as suitable food sources and insect species became associated with narrow groups of plants. The main point of the passage, therefore, is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells of present-day plants, result mainly from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage describes the interaction between plants and insects and how it has led to the development of secondary substances in plants. These secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive tastes and smells of plants, and they have evolved as a result of natural selection. Insects sometimes use these secondary substances to identify the plants that they can eat, and those that they cannot. This competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
The most accurate statement of the main point of the passage is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, including primary and secondary substances.
  Secondary substances provide plants with their distinctive tastes and smells and protect against insects.
  The origin of these substances is due to genetic mutations and the influence of insects through natural selection.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that plant-insect interactions have shaped the evolution of secondary substances in plants, leading to distinctive tastes and smells and providing defenses against insects.
  The correct answer is C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how the distinctive taste and smell of plants are a result of the secondary substances present in them.
  It describes how plants have two categories of chemical substances, one of which is secondary and gives them their characteristic flavors and odors.
  Insects played a crucial role in the origin and evolution of these secondary substances.
  Both competitive and cooperative interactions between plants and insects led to the development of secondary substances as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  The passage emphasizes the evolutionary processes that have shaped the relationship between plants and insects over many millions of years.
  The best choice is C, which accurately expresses the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage is primarily about the relationship between Plants and plant-eating insects, and how their characteristics interact with each other in the context of evolution.
The passage emphasizes the secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells, how insects play a major role in the development of these substances, and how plants evolved to use these substances to defend against plant-eating insects.
The passage also mentions the evolutionary competition between plants and insects, which leads to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and also a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
Option A emphasizes the natural defenses that secondary substances provide to plants against insects, which is a part of the passage. 
Option B is incorrect as the passage mentions how few different species of plants are suitable as food sources for any one species of insect. Still, it does not say that there is a narrowing of the range of secondary substances in plants as a result of the competition.
Option C is correct as it summarizes how the distinctive taste and smell result mainly due to the evolutionary interaction between plants and insects.
Option D summarizes the secondary substances' characteristics present in closely-related plants, but it is not the central point of the passage. 
Option E is incorrect as it only mentions the development of secondary substances in plants as a result of mutations, but it does not describe how it is related to competition with plant-eating insects.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the chemical composition of plants and how they contain both primary and secondary substances.
  The secondary substances have no role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism and are responsible for their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects play a significant role in the presence of secondary substances in plants as well as their chemical evolution.
  Plants and insects have been in an evolutionary competition for advantage, in which plants develop defenses against insects and insects evolve ways to circumvent plants' defenses.
  This competition has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The paragraph talks about the "cognitive framework" that jurors create in line 58.
According to the author, jurors create a cognitive framework that forms a guide for their analysis of the trial information.
This suggests that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
Therefore, A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The section that discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (lines 58) provides an explanation for why the stealing thunder strategy is limited by the early impression that is created by this cognitive framework, and how that impression affects jurors' subsequent analysis of trial information.
  Jurors are likely to use early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of trial information.
  The limitations of the stealing thunder strategy have as much to do with creating of a cognitive framework for jurors, as they do with framing evidence positively.
  Therefore, the reason why the author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (lines 58) is to indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

  Passage A seems to present new findings to challenge traditional ideas whereas Passage B presents a counter-proposal that suggests free will is still possible.
  The wording "adding fuel to the deterministic view" in Passage B implies that the author does not entirely agree with the view.
  Moreover, the phrase "Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that..." suggests that the author is willing to explore further, which implies a more engaged attitude toward the idea.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses findings in neuroscience that challenge the traditional view of law and punishment and suggests an alternative approach.
  Passage B discusses a philosophical theory of soft determinism that allows for the coexistence of determinism and free will.
  The question asks for the attitude displayed in Passage B toward the ideas it discusses in contrast to Passage A.
  Passage B presents a philosophical argument that is not explicitly related to the practical implications for law and punishment discussed in Passage A.
  The passage presents a well-explained and logical argument that does not exhibit any visible attitude.
  Therefore, the attitude of Passage B toward the ideas it discusses is detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage B seems to present another view on the topic.
  The passage presents a view from the philosopher Alfred J. Ayer on free actions and constrained actions and how they relate to free will.
  While passage A seems to be more dismissive towards the concept of free will, passage B seems to be more engaged and supportive of it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks how Passage B differs from Passage A in terms of attitude. 
  Passage A suggests that recent neuroscience findings suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms. 
  Passage B discusses the idea of "soft determinism" and distinguishes between free and constrained actions. It suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained and that the source of the cause determines whether an action is free. 
  Neither passage expresses an attitude or opinions that can be characterized as 'dismissal,' 'detachment,' 'irony,' or 'skepticism.' 
  Passage B, however, presents a more detailed and nuanced view of the subject than Passage A, with a theory that discusses the relationship between determinism and free will. 
  There is no clear indication of any attitude or engagement towards the idea. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses recent findings in neuroscience and how they changes the way we think about the law.
  It concludes that retribution is not worth punishing bad people as prevention of future harm should be the focus. 
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and soft determinism theory suggesting actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Neither passage presents any attitude towards the ideas discussed in the other.
  The question is about the attitude of Passage B compared to Passage A.
  As passages do not have any attitude towards each other, the most appropriate answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of recent neuroscience findings on the law.
  Passage B discusses the compatibility of determinism and free will.
  Passage A indicates that the law should abandon retribution as a justification of punishment and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B refers to the idea that actions can be free as long as they are not constrained.
  No information is provided in the given passages that suggests which of these passages is more engaged or dismissive.
  The answer that best describes the attitude in Passage B must be inferred from its content.
  Passage B argues in support of a philosophical idea, supporting it with an analogy.
  The passage explains and discusses the idea in detail, but does not dismiss or show skepticism towards the idea.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests changes to the law based on recent findings in neuroscience.
  Passage B discusses how determinism can coexist with the concept of free will.
  The language used in Passage A is more direct in calling for changes to the law.
  Passage B is more analytical instead of persuasive, discussing a philosophical theory.
  Passage B uses an analogy to explain the theory.
  The tone of Passage A is more engaged, while the tone of Passage B is more detached.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the law needs to abandon retribution in favor of future deterrence.
  Passage B discusses whether determinism could be compatible with the concept of free will.
  Nothing in Passage B suggests that the ideas in Passage A are completely incorrect or irrelevant—it simply does not address those ideas.
  Therefore, it is not dismissive, ironic, or skeptical. The passage seems to engage with the ideas thoughtfully and explores a related idea from a different perspective. 
  Given this, the attitude of Passage B is either "engaged" or "detached." 
  But the author is not taking a strong stance in favor of the ideas under discussion, and rather seems to be examining them thoughtfully and logically. 
  Therefore, the attitude of Passage B is "detached."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses how recent findings in neuroscience challenge our understanding of the law.
  Passage A asserts that free and rational moral choice may be an illusion and that the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B also discusses how determinism and free will can coexist. It presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism."
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It also raises the possibility that actions or wills originations from diseased brains are not free, although determined.
  Regarding the attitude displayed, Passage A argues for a specific approach to the law and is skeptical of the concepts of free will and retribution.
  In contrast, Passage B presents a theory that reconciles determinism and free will and is engaged in arguing for it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes a philosophical concept of "soft determinism" put forth by Ayer and argues that free will can coexist with determinism.
  The passage discusses the brain's role in free actions originating from a disease-free brain.
  The passage does not express a negative or doubtful attitude towards the ideas.
  Rather, it interprets Ayer's argument in greater detail and examines a possible analogy.
  Thus, it can be concluded that Passage B is detached and objective in tone.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still utilizes Western scientific methods which impose value judgments on non-Western cultures.
  To object to this criticism, we need to find an answer that shows that the second version does not impose Western scientific methods on non-Western cultures.
  Choice (A) states that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. This does not address the issue of whether the second version of multicultural education imposes Western scientific methods on non-Western cultures.
  Choice (B) talks about the similarity of non-Western societies' value systems. However, this does not address the issue of whether the second version of multicultural education imposes Western scientific methods on non-Western cultures.
  Choice (C) says that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. This suggests that the second version of multicultural education could utilize non-Western methods when studying other cultures, which would address the criticism.
  Choice (D) talks about understanding Western achievements through Western scientific investigations. This is somewhat related to the topic of multicultural education, but does not directly address the criticism of the second version.
  Choice (E) states that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This may be true, but does not address the issue of whether the second version of multicultural education imposes Western scientific methods on non-Western cultures.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education will be one that undermines the argument that non-scientific methods are necessary for understanding other cultures.
  Option A is not relevant to the discussion.
  Option B is not related to the discussion of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option C suggests that non-Western societies use their own values when studying cultures with different values, which supports the second version of multicultural education.
  Option D is not related to the discussion of multicultural education.
  Option E is not a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it does not adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied but rather the methods of Western scientific heritage.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, an answer choice should show that it is possible to genuinely understand another culture even if its value system is different from the value system of the majority culture and without relying on Western scientific methods.
  A is irrelevant to the argument. The objection is not about membership to a culture or perspective but about approach and methods.
  B does not address the argument.
  C does not contradict the argument but supports it and weakens the second version of multicultural education.
  D is irrelevant to the argument.
  E is true but does not provide a counter-argument to the criticism.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education is based on Western science methods
  Critics argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden and cannot adequately explain non-Western cultures
  The objection is that multicultural education must adopt the non-scientific approaches of other cultures
  To provide a strong objection to this criticism, we should show that Western science methods are still useful for multicultural education or that non-scientific approaches are not necessary for understanding other cultures
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education should show that it is different from the first version.
  The criticism against the second version is that it still uses the methods of the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  Objectors believe that non-Western values should be adopted.
  A statement that supports the use of Western scientific methods to explore other cultures could provide the strongest objection.
  Choice D describes the need to use Western scientific methods to understand Western culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first, and it is distorting to try to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science.
  The objection is that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism is an argument that supports the idea of adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve real understanding.
  Option A cannot be the answer because that would support the criticism, as the objection states that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  Option B also does not address the objection as it talks about the similarity of value systems between different non-Western societies.
  Option C is contradictory because it states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, but the second version of multicultural education advocates using only Western scientific methods.
  Option D is also not relevant because it talks about understanding Western culture and its achievements.
  Option E is not the answer because it is a premise on which the objection is based, not an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first and the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western.
  The objection is that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  To provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education, we must show that there is a way to adopt non-scientific perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures to achieve a genuine understanding and appreciation of that culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still Western-centric, despite trying to adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  The objection to the second version is that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourse of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  To object to this criticism, there needs to be a way to show that there is no privileging of Western discourse in the second version of multicultural education, and that it has found a way to allow a non-Western perspective in understanding other cultures.
  Therefore, option C could provide the strongest objection.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that its methods are Western and not appropriate for examining cultures whose perspectives and thought processes are based on myths, traditions, religions and mystical insights.
  The strongest objection would be an alternative method that is not Western, but still allows for proper understanding of non-Western cultures.
  Choice A is out of context and doesn't relate to the argument.
  Choice B does not contribute to the argument and is outside the context.
  Choice C attempts to invalidate the criticism that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still Western. But this is a weak objection as it doesn't provide an alternative method for examining non-western cultures.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the passage.
  Choice E is a statement supporting the position of the critics. 
  Therefore, Choices C and E are not valid objections while the strongest objection alternative method that addresses the criticism. Hence, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The second version of multicultural education is criticized for adopting Western scientific methods to study other cultures.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific perspective cannot adequately understand and appreciate non-Western cultures.
  The objection is that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  To overcome this criticism, one needs to find a choice that asserts the use of non-scientific cultural methods to understand other cultures adequately.
  Choice A, B, D, and E do not provide a strong enough objection to the criticism.
  Choice C asserts the use of their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  Therefore, choice C provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that "What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  It is specifically Schoenberg's ability to convey emotional states that music had not previously recorded that makes his music essential. 
  The explanation about his music becoming more condensed, violent, and sometimes disorienting indicates that this emotional intensity is a distinguishing feature.
  Looking at the choices, only one statement deals explicitly with conveying difficult truths and potentially causing discomfort. 
  The correct answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes Schoenberg’s music as disturbing because it precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before
  Therefore, an analogous disturbing thing is something that accurately captures unsettling and previously unexplored aspects of human experience
  B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, fits this description well
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: The passage explains that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Therefore, to answer which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54, it must be an art form that precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that people are unfamiliar with before. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the emotional states recorded in Schoenberg’s music were sometimes disquieting and how it cannot be reduced to the 12-tone technique.
  We are asked to identify which of the given options refers to something else that is similarly disturbing.
  None of the other given options is a form of art or expression similar to music.
  Answer option B talks about a comedian’s humor that shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore. It could be the correct answer.
  Answer option A is about vulgar humor, option C is about repeated material and option D is about extreme political philosophy, but none of these options represents an analogy for Schoenberg's music.
  Answer option E does not offer any detail to enable comparison with Schoenberg's music.
  Thus, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it is able to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that were previously unrecorded in music.
  We are asked to find an option that is most analogous to the above statement.
  Option A talks about a comedian whose material relies on vulgar humor which is not usually disturbing in this way; hence it can be eliminated.
  Option C talks about a comedian whose material is composed of material already made famous by other comedians which is not disturbing.
  Option D talks about a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy which could be disturbing to some, but it is not analogous to how Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  Option E talks about a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience which could be unsettling, but not in a way that's comparable to how Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  Thus, the answer isB: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore is analogous to Schoenberg's music in its ability to precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that were previously unrecorded.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: The passage talks about how Schoenberg's music was disturbing because it expressed emotional states that music had not recorded before. It says that it is not because of how the music is made, but what it has to say.
Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B is the most analogous to Schoenberg's disturbing work because according to the passage, like Schoenberg's music, the comedian shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage argues that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, we are looking for something that can create disquieting emotional states in an analogous way.
  Choice A doesn't fit because it is simply vulgar humor, not deeper disquieting emotional states.
  Choice C is just repetitive of material already made famous by other comedians, which is not disquieting.
  Choice D talks about an extreme political philosophy, whereas the passage is discussing music's emotional impact, so it is not a suitable choice.
  Choice E mentions unfamiliar style of humor, which doesn't create disquieting emotional states alone.
  The only answer choice that mentions anything remotely like creating disquieting emotional states is Choice B which mentions a comedian whose humor "shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Similar to Schoenberg, the comedian in the answer choice must also present a perspective on difficult and unrecognized truths in order to be disturbing.
  The correct answer should show similarity to this aspect rather than the tonality and complexity of the music.
  Answer B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore is a close match as it shares the same aspect. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage states that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it precisely delineates recognisable and sometimes disturbing emotional states that music had not recorded before.
To answer the question, look for a similar option in which someone else is doing something which is disturbing in a unique and innovative way.
Option A: A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor - This option talks about a comedian who relies on vulgar humor. But it is not innovatively disturbing, and vulgar humor is not unique to the comedian.
Option B: A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore - This option is analogous to Schoenberg's music, as it talks about a comedian whose humor is disturbing in a way that is innovative and unique in addressing human nature.
Option C: A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians - This option does not talk about anyone doing something innovative or disturbing.
Option D: A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy - This option does not talk about anyone doing something innovative or disturbing.
Option E: A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience - This option does not talk about anyone doing something innovative or disturbing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before".
  Therefore, the thing that could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way Schoenberg's music is disturbing is something that precisely delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that have not been presented before.
  Both options A and C are not presenting anything new or unfamiliar, and they are not precisely delineating any emotional states that haven't been heard before. 
  Option D is more of an expression of disapproval or disagreement on the part of the comedian not necessarily providing the audience with something they haven't seen before that could be disquieting.
  Option E is only referencing an unfamiliar style which may not necessarily be disturbing.
  Option B appears to be in line with the idea expressed in the paragraph regarding Schoenberg's music.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the objections to the second version of multicultural education, which holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that has certain values such as objectivity and the scientific perspective should not be used to understand nonscientific cultures.
  Therefore, the proponents of the third version of multicultural education would likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage presents two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education suggests that a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures should be taken.
  However, this version of multicultural education is not considered different from the first version by some critics due to its inherent Eurocentrism.
  These critics argue that trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but it is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture is something that would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses a second version of multicultural education that has developed in response to the first proposal.
  This second version advocates a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still Western.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, proponents of this version of multicultural education would likely find a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses a second version of multicultural education.
  This version argues that multicultural education must adopt a neutral stance in respect to the value differences among cultures.
  However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education have objected to the use of Western scientific methods to study and understand non-scientific cultures, arguing that it is not different from the first version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture is the option that is most likely considered objectionable by the proponents of this version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  According to the third paragraph, proponents of the third version of multicultural education believe that non-scientific cultures should be understood through their own methods and perspectives.
  The author also suggests that Western scientific techniques operate under their own set of values that some critics consider problematic.
  In light of this, it seems that proponents of the third version of multicultural education would object to using Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  Choice C describes this objection.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question refers to "proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph", so we need to focus on the third paragraph.
  According to the passage, the second version of the multicultural education differs from the first "in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures".
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western, while critics of this version argue that these methods are already value-laden and that it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Option A does not violate the second version of multicultural education's neutral stance and may be considered compatible. Option B describes a type of cultural examination and evaluation that is not based on the majority culture's perspectives, but rather those of the cultures studied. Option D is not related to the methods of multicultural education.
  Option C depicts a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, which is not compatible with the second version of multicultural education's neutral stance toward value differences among cultures. Therefore, option C would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The third paragraph of the passage discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education calls for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, and for each culture to be taken on its own terms.
  However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version still derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. 
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that such a stance does not allow for true understanding of non-Western cultures, and that using the methods of Western science to investigate non-scientific cultures is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two versions of multicultural education that have been proposed.
  The third paragraph is primarily concerned with criticizing the second version of multicultural education.
  Proponents of the second version of multicultural education argue that the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology should be used to study other cultures.
  Critics argue that these methods come from a Western scientific perspective and heritage, and are not necessarily applicable to all non-Western cultures.
  According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  This paragraph argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden as they rely on the Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  The Western scientific heritage values objectivity over subjectivity, logic over intuition, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. 
  Critics of this version of multicultural education argue that the approach is not different from the first as the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are identifiable Western.
  This makes it an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism, the chauvinism of science.
  Therefore, studying nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is the most likely objectionable to proponents of this version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The third paragraph defines the objections against the second version of multicultural education.
  The objection is that the methods of examination used in multicultural education are Western-scientific perspective that expressed an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The objection is against the approach of trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science.
  Thus, it is most likely that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.

Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The article details multiple times how CJD is fatal and describes the mechanism for prion induced nerve cell destruction, so B is incorrect.
  The article discusses at length how prions lack nucleic acid and reproduce via structural conformation change, so C is incorrect.
  The article states that the body does not produce an immune response to prions, so D is incorrect.
  The article details how prions are responsible for CJD and can cause other neurological conditions, so A is incorrect.
  The only remaining option is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that CJD is inevitably fatal, which means that recovery from the disease is unlikely.
  The passage also mentions that prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, which means that the body does not produce an immune response when they are present, indicating that the body does not have a natural defense against CJD.
  Therefore, the author is least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover, as the passage describes CJD as inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  The passage states that prions have infectious properties and are capable of reproducing themselves in an unexpected way.
  The passage explains that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins but they possess an abnormal structure that provokes a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  The passage also mentions that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
  The author would least likely agree with option B that a patient will recover from CJD because the passage explains that CJD is inevitably fatal, and it does not even mention any treatment or recovery options for it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author describes prions and their unique characteristics.
  The author explains that CJD is fatal and there is no effective treatment.
  The author emphasizes the lack of immune response produced by the body in response to prions.
  The statement that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with best reflects a piece of information that strongly opposes what the author has explained.
  Hence, the author is least likely to agree with choice B: "Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage states that CJD caused by prions is fatal, and there is no effective therapy for its prevention.
  The author describes that prions in an abnormal conformation reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction in the brain.
  The author provides information about the discovery of prions as an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.
  It is not mentioned in the passage that patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author mentions in the passage that CJD is inevitably fatal and the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. Thus, the author would not be in favor of the idea of patient's recovery from CJD.
  The author has mentioned a lot about prions and their capability of reproducing themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after the other. Also, it is now believed that similar processes of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Thus, prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction and the body has no natural defense against CJD.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no effective therapies for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves. Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so the author would likely disagree with choice B.
  The author agrees that abnormally shaped prions cause neurological disease like CJD, so A is not the answer.
  The author acknowledges that prions do not require nucleic acid, so C is not the answer.
  The author explains that the body has no natural defense against CJD, so D is not the answer.
  The author states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood, so E is not the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage clearly explains the impact of prions on the human body and the causation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  It highlights that in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal.
  The author emphasizes that prions that are harmful are capable of reproducing themselves through a chain reaction, and the body does not produce an immune response against these cells.
  Any option that contradicts these facts or providing an opposite view can be inferred as least likely to agree with the author.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author mentioned that CJD is always fatal with no effective therapy, so it's unlikely that some patients will recover from the disease.
  The author explained that prions occur naturally in the body and do not trigger an immune response when present, so the body does not have a natural defense against CJD. This means D is a correct statement.
  The author explained that prions lack nucleic acid but have the ability to reproduce themselves.
  The author mentioned that prions possess the capability of converting their structures into abnormal shape and inducing other prions to do the same, so the presence of abnormally shaped prions indicates neurological disease. Hence, A is also not the correct answer.
  The author mentioned that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be fully understood, so E is not the correct answer.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought:
- The utility maximization principle states that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
- In other words, people conduct a rational cost-benefit analysis before committing a crime.
- Choice A, B, C, and D describe individuals making rational decisions based on economic incentives or disincentives.
- Choice E describes an impulsive crime of passion, not a rational economic choice based on cost-benefit analysis.
- Therefore, choice E would be the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  To analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime, their expected utility of outcomes must be weighed according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  Given an individual's decision, this principle allows analysis of an individual's rational economic choice.
  All the given examples involve some rational economic reasoning when making a decision.
  However, one of the examples may involve more than just a rational economic choice.
  Option E, where the worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, does not involve rational reasoning of weighing the possible outcomes.
  Therefore, option E would be the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle suggests people make a rational trade-off between incentives and disincentives to choose their actions.
  The expected utility of an action is calculated based on the utilities of its possible outcomes weighed according to their likelihoods.
  The rational response to incentives and disincentives implies an individual's conscious decision to optimize positive outcomes.
  A, B, C and D seem to be rational responses in comparison to E, which appears more driven by emotion and frustration than by rational and quantitative economic calculation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle holds that a rational individual responds to economic incentives and disincentives.
  To analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime within this economic framework, one should consider the expected utility of both legal and illegal activities.
  The individual would commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility of lawful activity.
  The question asks for an option that is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Only one option must be selected as the answer.
  Option A, B, C, and D all show how individuals respond rationally to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Only Option E shows an irrational, impulsive response to losing a job.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The question asks us to determine which response is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  According to the economic principle of utility maximization, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  All of the options involve some kind of rational calculation of costs and benefits.
  Option A involves concealing income to reduce tax burden.
  Option B involves not speeding to avoid loss of driver's license.
  Option C involves discharging pollutant without treatment because of lower cost than the penalty for doing so.
  Option D involves soliciting bribes because of inadequate government salary.
  Option E involves physical assault as a response to losing a job.
  The option that would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is option E because physical assault is not a rational response to losing a job; it is an impulsive and illegal act of aggression.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  From the given options, only one of the choices seems to be an action that is not a rational response to economic incentives.
  Option A is a rational response to economic incentives as the waiter's action of concealing a part of tip income reduces his taxes and increases his take-home income.
  Option B is a rational response to economic disincentives as the motorist avoids speeding to prevent loss of her driver's license which could lead to even more economic disincentives, such as having to take public transit or carpool to work.
  Option C is a rational response to economic incentives as the industrialist continues to illegally discharge untreated pollutant to save on cost which is a rational economic decision despite the environmental havoc it may cause.
  Option D is a rational response to economic incentives as the government official solicits bribes because the inflation has rendered her salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  Option E is not a rational response to economic incentives as physical assault on the former supervisor will mainly result in negative consequences for the worker, such as getting fired, and may even cause harm to him.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage defines a rational response as one that maximizes anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The examples presented are evaluated in terms of whether the action taken maximizes the expected overall satisfaction of the individual.
  Options A, B, C, and D seem to be actions that maximize the expected overall satisfaction of the individual by responding to potential economic disincentives.
  Therefore, a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would not involve committing a crime of passion like physical assault, as outlined in option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The economic principle of utility maximization explains that a rational person will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action.
  Weighting each outcome according to the likelihood of it coming to pass, and adding those weighted utilities provides an expected utility.
  Therefore, an action that is chosen using expected utility by a rational person is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. 
  A, B, C, and D each present a scenario where a person responds rationally to economic incentives and disincentives by choosing an action based on expected utility.
  However, E describes an impulsive crime, which is not a choice based on expected utility but rather an emotional response.
  The answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that individuals choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility given a choice of available actions.
  The expected utility of an action is calculated by determining the utilities of possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is the one where the expected utility of an action is maximized.
  A, B, C, and D are all examples of individuals making a rational choice to maximize their expected utility.
  E, on the other hand, involves an impulsive act of retaliation that does not seem to involve a rational assessment of the expected utility of the action.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question is asking to identify which one of the following scenarios is least described as a rational response to economic incentives.
  The economic principle of utility maximization suggests that individuals behave rationally in response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The scenario that is least described as a rational response to economic incentives is the one where the expected utility is not maximum.
  Option A involves tax evasion, which is an attempt to maximize personal income.
  Option B involves following the law to avoid negative consequences, which is an attempt to minimize potential losses.
  Option C involves cost-benefit analysis, which is an attempt to maximize profits.
  Option D involves pursuing a bribe to maximize income security.
  Option E involves physical assault, for which there is no economic incentive.
  Therefore, option E would be the least described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.
  D: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the evolution of Schoenberg's musical style.
  Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles.
  The first style was the late-Romantic manner (music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies).
  The second style was nontonal music without tonal centers.
  The third style was 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music.
  The author of the passage believes that "What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  Based on this, the passage suggests that each style represents a natural progression from the previous style.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles.
  The first style is the late-Romantic manner with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style pushes unstable harmonies to no longer have a tonal basis.
  The third style is the 12-tone technique which brings a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizes it.
  The author indicates that Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles.
  The author indicates that Schoenberg's music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts and therefore more difficult to follow as his career progressed. 
  However, what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Therefore, it can be inferred the author would most likely agree with the statement that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg worked in three different musical styles.
  The first style is the late-Romantic manner which was pervasive in his youth.
  The second style pushed unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style is the 12-tone technique which is a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
  The passage also mentioned that in all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery.
  It can be inferred from the passage that the author would consider Schoenberg as an essential figure in music history, and his music provides new emotional states previously unrecorded.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  The answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles.
  The article describes each of the three styles and considers the reasons why Schoenberg developed them.
  While the author acknowledges that the third style is more difficult to follow, he also writes that "Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery" and "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
  From this, it can be inferred that the author would be most likely to agree with statement E, that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author mentions three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The author explains what each of those styles represents and how Schoenberg evolved as a composer.
  The author mentions that Schoenberg's music evolved in part because it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music while also expressing what he was compelled to express.
  The author mentions that Schoenberg's music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and more difficult to follow as his career progressed.
  The author explains what makes Schoenberg's music essential.
  Based on this, it can be inferred that the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The first style of Schoenberg's music was late-Romantic.
  In his second style, he took the unstable harmonies beyond their tonal basis.
  The 12-tone technique was developed in his third style to bring a new system of order to nontonal music.
  The third style was also developed as a natural progression towards the stabilization of non-tonal music.  
  Option A claims that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one and this aligns with the fact stated in the thought about the third style.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes the way in which Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles. 
  The author characterizes Schoenberg's technical mastery as awe-inspiring across all three of his styles.
  The author states that in all three styles, Schoenberg was able to delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states better than any before him.
  The author implies that some of Schoenberg's work remains disturbing because it faces difficult truths.
  Based on this information, it can be inferred that the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, and the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
  The statement that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one is too general and not specific to the information given in the passage.
  The statement that each successive style represents an inexplicable departure from the previous one is too extreme and contradicts the author's characterization of Schoenberg's technical mastery across all three styles.
  The statement that the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second is not supported by the author's characterization of the three styles.
  The statement that the third style represents a natural progression from the first is not supported by the author's characterization of the three styles or the fact that Schoenberg's second style was a departure from the first.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage mentioned that Schoenberg evolved through three different musical styles.
  According to the passage, the three styles are late-Romantic manner, unstable harmony, and the 12-tone technique.
  The passage states that "Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery" in all three styles.
  The passage also notes that some of his work remains disturbing because it is groundbreaking in its delineation of new emotional states.
  There is no evidence suggesting that Schoenberg's second style is an inexplicable departure from his first.
  However, there is evidence suggesting that his third style is a natural progression from his second style.
  Therefore, the answer should be D: The second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author describes the evolution of Schoenberg's music through three different styles.
  The first style is a late romantic style with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style is characterized as lacking a tonal basis and being more dissonant and nontonal, but this was, according to Schoenberg, the next inevitable step in the historical development of music.
  In the third style, Schoenberg developed the 12-tone technique as a means of stabilizing nontonal music.
  The author emphasizes the technical mastery of Schoenberg in all three styles but focuses on Schoenberg's innovative and expressive emotional output.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how Schoenberg evolved through three different musical styles. 
  The passage provides some explanation about why Schoenberg adopted each new style.
  The passage does not suggest that Schoenberg's transitions from one style to another were inexplicable.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art has been produced for and by the elite.
  There are two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
  Sociohistorical critics prefer that art be produced to express the ideals of the elite.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced art that endures.
  Because some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite needs justifying.
  The main point of the passage is the discussion of how members of the elite classes historically produced art.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage discusses the historical production of art by and for the political and social elites, as well as the attitudes towards the aristocracy and the middle class. The passage suggests that there are two ways in which members of the elite have had art produced for them, and that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to claim that art embodies the ideals of the elite. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two ways in which art has historically been commissioned by the elitist class.
  One way is to enhance their reputation among their peers.
  The second way is to have created work that expressed that class's ideals and way of life.
  The talented artists often had to work with unconventional patrons with eccentric tastes.
  The historical class background (aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class) of patrons of art has not been necessarily instrumental in producing art that endures.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in a way of Freudian analysis to explain the thought that such art embodied the ideology of the elite irrespective of the identity of the artist.
Conclusion: 
  The main idea of the passage is to explain the two ways in which the elitist class has historically commissioned art and how sociohistorical critics justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite in light of apparently conflicting evidence. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The passage begins by discussing the view that art is produced by and for a dominant class, and then describes two different ways in which art was historically produced for the elite. The passage then discusses how sociohistorical critics analyze art, and raises questions about whether or not such analyses are accurate. The main point of the passage is about the complexities of the relationship between art and the social and political forces that shape it, and how sociohistorical critics have attempted to make sense of these complexities. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the different ways the elite commissioned art.
  It also outlines the problems and criticisms of sociohistorical interpretations of art produced by the elite.
  The main point is that sociohistorical interpretations of art produced by the elite are overly simplistic and require a more nuanced analysis.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two ways that the elite have commissioned art.
  The first way was to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
  The second way was to create or have created a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critics deal with the second type of commissioned art.
  Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians and the middle class as Philistines, who were not apt to produce art that endures.
  The talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes.
  The sociohistorical critic claims that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and the sociohistorical critics claim that, in hidden ways, such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  The answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

Thought:
  The article discusses the way art was historically created and commissioned by the elite.
  It examines two different ways art was commissioned by the elite.
  The sociohistorical critics analyze the way art embodied the ideology of the elite by dealing with the art produced the second way.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced an art that endures.
  Artists needed to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Sociohistorical critics must engage in a kind of Freudian analysis to explain that forbidden art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and preventing subversion by artists was not always easy.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how art has been commissioned historically by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes.
  The passage highlights that the taste of the aristocracy and the middle class has not always been able to produce enduring art.
  It distinguishes between two ways in which members of elite classes have had art produced for them, one in which they asked for whatever they pleased, and the other where they had the work reflect their values.
  The Sociohistorical critics analyze art produced in the second way as it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of the patronage to support such analyses.
  The answer is not C as it is a generalization, and the passage does not emphasize the interest of the patrons.
  The answer is not A as it emphasizes only one aspect of the discussion without connecting to the broader context of the sociohistorical analyses.
  The answer is not B as it goes against the central theory of sociohistorical analysis presented in the passage.
  The answer is not D as it is only discussing the analytical approach of socio-historical critics and is not the main point of the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: The author refers. to the early days of biotechnology (line 38) primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: furnish a brief account of the evolution of academic biotechnology research
  B: establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented
  C: express nostalgia for a time when biotechnology research was untainted by commercial motives

  The author discusses the early days of biotechnology in the context of changes to the communal tradition of sharing research materials.
  The author also notes that even in the early days of biotechnology, researchers took measures to prevent others from gaining access to their materials.
  These examples indicate that present competitive practices are not entirely unprecedented.
  Therefore, the author referred to the early days of biotechnology primarily to establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented.
  The answer is B: establish that present competitive practices in biotechnology research are not entirely unprecedented.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author mentions early days of biotechnology to make a point about how researchers have always tried to impede the access of their competitors on their research materials.
  The point is that researchers long ago had a marketable approach even though they functioned in a time when research materials were on a shared resource model instead of on market model.
  Option E implies that the author provides a historical justification for opposition to biotechnology patents, which is partially correct, but not the only purpose of mentioning early days of biotechnology.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author criticizes the earlier scholarship of focusing solely on as-told-to life histories recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators, which overlooks the traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history in Native American cultures.
  The author states that these earlier scholars have overlooked the highly diverse Native American cultures, and failed to acknowledge that the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events.
  The author also explains that the idea of self was markedly inclusive in some Native American cultures, and that autobiographical expressions included songs, chants, stories, drama, tattoos, shields, robes, and tepees painted with symbolic designs.
  Based on this, the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship is negative, and the best phrase that conveys this attitude is "failed to address" (line 9).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The question asks about the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author describes how most scholars have focused on written, bicultural composite authorship that emerged from non-Native American collaborators.
  Then, the author explains how those scholars have overlooked traditional preliterate modes of communicating personal history and the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples.
  The question asks which phrase best conveys the author's attitude toward this earlier scholarship.
  The phrase "failed to address" in line 9 is neutral and doesn't convey the author's attitude.
  The phrase "highly diverse" in line 10 is descriptive and does not convey the author's attitude.
  The phrase "markedly inclusive" in line 16 is also descriptive and does not convey the author's attitude.
  The phrase "seemingly more fragmented" in line 24 is descriptive.
  The phrase "alien to the European style" suggests some disapproval or criticism of the European style of autobiography and how Native American autobiography is different.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: "alien to the European style" (line 51).
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for the author's attitude towards the earlier scholarship.
  The author describes the "Limiting their studies" (line 2) and that "these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history" (line 7).
  Therefore, the author is critical of the earlier scholarship since they did not consider alternative modes of autobiographical expression.
Action: Answer("A")  
The phrase "failed to address" (line 9) conveys the author's critical attitude toward the earlier scholarship that focused only on written documents and did not consider traditional modes of autobiographical expression.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks about the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship mention in the passage.
  The author talks about the limits of earlier scholarship in studying Native American autobiographies that are told-to-life histories.
  The author states that these studies have overlooked traditional modes of communication of personal history among Native Americans.
  Therefore, the author has a critical attitude towards the earlier scholarship mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author mentions earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author outlines some limitations of these studies.
  The question asks for the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  The author does not use any positive adjectives to describe the earlier scholarship.
  Instead, the author outlines limitations of these earlier studies and implies an unfavorable attitude.
  The best choice that conveys the author's attitude is the negative phrase.
  "Failed to address" and "seemingly more fragmented" describe limitations, but they are not negative.
  "Highly diverse" and "markedly inclusive" are positive phrases, so they cannot convey the author's negative attitude.
  "Alien to the European style" is negative, but it describes intercultural collaboration rather than earlier scholarship.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  To determine the author's attitude, I need to look for any positive or negative connotations that the author might have towards the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies mentioned in the passage.
  The author states that the earlier scholars who studied autobiographies of Native Americans focused on written documents that were limited in their approach.
  The passage states, "Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history" (lines 3-5).
  The author gives an alternative approach (pre-contact Native American cultures) as being more inclusive and authentic to their culture.
  Therefore, the author holds a negative attitude towards the earlier scholarship because it missed alternative approaches to the study of Native American autobiographical expression.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author discusses the limitations of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author notes that earlier scholars have focused on written documents and ignored traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The author also argues that earlier scholars have failed to address the cultural constructs of Native American peoples, who did not share the same assumptions about self, life, and writing as Europeans.
  The author suggests that earlier scholarship is lacking in its approach to understanding Native American autobiography.
  The phrase that best conveys this attitude is "failed to address" because it highlights a specific limitation of earlier scholarship and suggests that it is incomplete. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks about the author's attitude regarding earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The passage describes the earlier scholarship as having "overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history" and as having "failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples".
  The passage suggests that the earlier scholarship was limited in scope and focused only on written documents.
  The passage does not indicate that the author is particularly positive or negative towards the earlier scholarship.
  Among the answer choices, "overlooked" is a negative term and may represent a critical tone.
  However, since the passage does not provide any other clues suggesting a negative tone, it is difficult to say that the author is critical.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question is asking for the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The author describes the previous scholarship of Native American autobiographies as "Limiting their studies" and "overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history."
  This negative connotation suggests a critical attitude from the author's perspective.
  Therefore, the phrase that best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies is "Limiting their studies" in line 2.
  The answer is not B. Highly diverse, or C. Markedly inclusive refers to Native American peoples and their cultural constructs, not earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The answer is not D. Seemingly more fragmented is a comparison to European custom and doesn't provide the attitude towards the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The answer is not E. Alien to the European style also compares to European style and does not refer to earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks us to identify the attitude of the author towards earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies.
  The passage highlights the limitations of this scholarship and why such an approach is incomplete.
  The phrase that best conveys the author's attitude is one that indicates a negative assessment of this earlier scholarship.
  The author seems critical of these scholars' narrow approach and failure to understand the broader context of Native American society and culture.
  The phrase that best fits this description is "failed to address" used in line 9.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism
  D: admiration for its subtle critique of contemporary culture
  E: appreciation for its ability to incorporate both realism and naivete

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The question asks which choice undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Because bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business and competition is necessary.
  Choice A describes a case where monopoly power exists without being a dominant force in the entire industry.
  Choice B is related to the Pin Factory, but does not undermine the connection between increasing size and monopoly power.
  Choice C reinforces the natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Choice D does not undermine the argument as it acknowledges that the size varies, but still helps bigger firms get larger.
  Choice E argues that there are diminishing returns to specialization, not that increasing returns do not lead to monopoly.
  Therefore, the best answer is A, since it describes a situation that contradicts the implied connection between increasing size and monopoly power.  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The article explains that increasing returns to scale tend to create monopoly power, whereas the invisible hand depends on a competitive market with no monopoly.
  The question is asking for the answer that most undermines this connection.
  Answer A provides an example of a larger business that is not able to exert monopoly power in a region.
  Thus, the connection between increased size in a business and monopoly is not absolute because there are other factors that can mitigate the tendency to monopolize.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly because larger firms achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business. 
  The author argues there must be many competitors in each industry for the invisible hand to work properly. 
  To undermine this connection, we need to present a situation where increasing returns do not lead to monopoly power. 
  Choice A doesn't undermine the argument since the author is arguing that the natural tendency is towards monopoly; there can still be exceptions. 
  Choice B is irrelevant since the argument is not about how much workers are paid. 
  Choice C strengthens the argument since collusion is an even more potent form of monopoly power. 
  Choice D undermines the argument since the natural tendency to monopoly is not inevitable. 
  Choice E doesn't undermine the argument since it only argues that any gains in productivity are offset by other factors; it doesn't argue that there is no tendency towards monopoly power.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author describes the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, but for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  We need to find the option which undermines this connection.
  Option A talks about businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. This shows that the size of businesses is not the only determining factor for monopoly power.
  Thus, option A undermines the connection made by the author between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale creates a tendency toward monopoly because larger businesses have lower costs.
  The author also argues that for a market to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the author's argument depends on the assumption that there are diminishing returns to scale, not increasing returns.
  In other words, the connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the assumption that larger businesses have much lower costs and thus can drive smaller players out of business.
  To break this connection, we need to show that the assumption of lower costs for larger players does not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  If we can show that larger businesses can have higher costs than smaller competitors, even as they achieve increasing returns to scale, then we can make the author's argument less compelling.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The question asks which option would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  The passage states that increasing returns create natural tendencies towards monopoly because bigger firms can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller firms and given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business.
  The passage implies that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated the economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized because it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance.
  The passage suggests that "only since the late 1970s," economists could describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
  Option A, B and C are unrelated, as they either do not talk about the connection between increased size and monopoly power or they show how monopoly power still exists even with larger firms in the industry.
  Option D suggests that the size a business needs to reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry, but this does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option E suggests that some gains achieved by making specialized workers become more specialized are offset by higher training costs etc. This option weakens the idea that specialized workers always lead to increased productivity and thus, undermining the link between increased size and productivity.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to larger firms competing more effectively against smaller firms and driving them out of business to exert increasing monopoly power.
  The author further argues that for the invisible hand mechanism to work, there must be many competitors in each industry so that no one can exert monopoly power.
  An answer choice that suggests that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to such dominance could undermine this argument.
  Option D suggests that the size that a business must achieve to benefit from increasing returns varies by industry, implying that a business model that works in one industry could be inefficient in another.
  Option D, therefore, contradicts the author's argument that increasing returns to scale lead to larger firms dominating smaller competitors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized, whereas economics of increasing returns are hard to represent mathematically.
  The author mentions that increasing returns, if not checked, create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author states that the idea that the free market always gets it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  The question is asking us to find a statement that weakens the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  Answer choice A is irrelevant to whether increased size leads to monopoly power or not. 
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant. 
  Answer choice C reinforces the author's argument that increasing returns create a tendency towards monopoly. 
  Answer choice D does not weaken the author's argument, but it does suggest that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies.
  Answer choice E is also irrelevant. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns tend to create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The reason is that a large business can achieve larger scale and lower costs than a small business.
  But monopoly power contradicts the idea of the invisible hand working properly.
  The invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  The idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  If there were evidence that the assumption of diminishing returns was incorrect or limited, the author's argument would be undermined.
  Only statement D could provide this evidence because if the assumption of the size required to achieve increasing returns varied widely from industry to industry, then there might not be a natural tendency toward monopoly across all industries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
  Therefore, to undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, we need to show an example where the increasing return to scale does not lead to monopoly power.
  Answer choice A talks about how a large business may not always be dominant in all regions, suggesting that increasing return to scale does not guarantee monopoly power.
  Answer choice B does not address the issue of monopoly power and instead talks about the effect of specialization on salary.
  Answer choice C reinforces the argument that increasing returns to scale leads to monopoly power.
  Answer choice D presents some variation in size required for achieving increasing returns to scale but does not undermine the argument about monopoly power in any way.
  Answer choice E talks about potential costs associated with specializing workers and doesn't address the issue of monopoly power.
  Therefore, the best answer that undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power is A.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Thought:
  In passage A, Popper's contribution to philosophy of science is discussed, and it mentions that scientific research involves generating bold theories and finding negative evidence to disprove them.
  In passage B, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus but later found that their prediction was incorrect. They changed their assumptions and hypothesized the existence of another planet to explain their observations.
  This is an example of revising a theory based on evidence that did not match the predictions made by the theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which concerns the power of negative evidence.
  The passage states that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. 
  Passage B illustrates an example from astronomy, where astronomers attempted to predict Uranus's orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises, but their prediction was incorrect. 
  They then revised their auxiliary premises and hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they later discovered to be Neptune. 
  It is clear that the astronomers revised their theory by revising their auxiliary premises to include the existence of another planet to explain the observations. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's contributions to the philosophy of science.
  Passage B discusses the discovery of the planet Uranus and the predictions made by astronomers based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers' predictions turned out to be incorrect, and they had to change their auxiliary assumptions about the existence of planets to explain the discrepancy.
  This was an example of revising a theory based on new evidence.
  The answer should be B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A introduces Karl Popper's ideas on the scientific method, including the importance of generating testable hypotheses.
  Passage B describes how astronomers worked to explain discrepancies in observations of Uranus and Mercury.
  The astronomers were using Newton's laws and developing auxiliary assumptions to predict orbits of various planets.
  In the case of Uranus, the predicted orbit was incorrect and the astronomers adjusted their assumption to include the existence of another planet (Neptune).
  In the case of Mercury, the predicted orbit was also incorrect and the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet (Vulcan) to explain the discrepancies.
  In both cases, the astronomers were revising their original theories to accommodate new information.
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage B illustrates astronomers changing their assumptions and theories in response to the failure of predictions.
  The astronomers predicted the orbits of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The predictions failed due to the incorrect auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers revised their assumptions, concluded there must be another planet, and hypothesized the existence of a planet named Vulcan.
  Passage A states that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Therefore the point illustrated in Passage B, changing and revising theories in response to evidence, corresponds to the central idea of Passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science.
  Popper's theory is about disproving a hypothesis.
  Passage B discusses predicting the orbit of planets.
  The scientists attempted to predict Uranus's orbit based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions but found that their predictions were incorrect.
  They revised their assumptions and later discovered Neptune.
  They also predicted the orbit of Mercury, but the predictions were not borne out.
  The scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, but it was never found.
  Later, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
  This illustrates the need to revise a theory when predictions do not match observations.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science and his perspective on the importance of negative evidence.
  Passage B talks about examples where scientists predicted the orbit of two different planets using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions but failed to observe the predicted orbit, which required revising their theories.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science.
  Popper believes that negative evidence is at the heart of scientific research, and that scientific theories must be testable.
  The passage addresses the ascendancy of negative evidence over positive evidence and how both are used in scientific experiments and research.
  Passage B describes the discovery of the planet Neptune using Newton's laws to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  Scientists discover that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit of Uranus using auxiliary assumptions based on Newton's laws.
  The discovery of Neptune proves the validity of the original hypothesis.
  The development of Einstein's general theory of relativity later confirmed the hypothesis and contributed to increasing confidence in Einstein's theory.
  The passage does not mention repudiating experimental results or theories that are not testable by experiment.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's philosophy of science.

Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the ethnic consciousness of Mexican Americans.
  The passage notes that there were differences in opinion among Mexican American groups during the 1930s and 1940s on political issues.
  The passage questions whether the views of Mexican American activists were representative of the broader Mexican American population.
  The passage also questions whether an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Based on this information, the passage supports the statement that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage discusses ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans, but it is critical of the author of the study’s conclusions about the degree of political diversity and the representativeness of activists to the Mexican American population as a whole. Therefore, the passage does not explicitly support any statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage concludes that it is not clear how far the outlook of activists represented the Mexican American population at large
  To assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States resulted in an increase in political activism among the ethnic Mexican population would be wrong without considering other variables such as patterns of Mexican immigration and naturalization
  Therefore, the statement that best describes the passage's stance on ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans is that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage mentions that a better understanding of variables like patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization are important in determining whether the increase in Mexican Americans born in the US led to an increase in political activism.
Nowhere in the passage, it is mentioned that the consistency of ethnic consciousness is directly related to an increase or decrease in Mexican immigration and naturalization or assimilation. 
The passage tries to argue that the political diversity of the Mexican American Generation indicates the variation in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
So, the answer is D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage discusses the degree to which the views of Mexican American leaders were representative of the larger Mexican American population.
It notes that there is no clear evidence to suggest that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States automatically led to an increase in political activism, highlighting the importance of other variables such as patterns of immigration and naturalization in shaping ethnic consciousness.
Therefore, the answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans from 1930 to 1960.
  The passage makes no clear argument about how ethnic consciousness changes in response to rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization or the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States.
  Instead, the passage suggests that patterns of immigration and naturalization and the resulting variations in ethnic consciousness must be better understood before assumptions about the relationship between ethnic consciousness and these variables can be made.
  The passage also suggests that the relationship between Mexican American leaders and the broader Mexican American population with respect to ethnic consciousness is uncertain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the increase in the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States, which led to a new generation of Mexican American leaders appearing in the U.S.
  These leaders were more acculturated and hence more politically active than the previous generation.
  The passage, however, does not support any statement about the effect of ethnic consciousness on the rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
  Therefore, options A and E are incorrect.
  The passage talks about the variations in ethnic consciousness but does not support that ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  Hence, option B is incorrect.
  The passage does not state that ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases. Hence, option C is incorrect.
  Finally, the passage supports the statement that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the extent to which the views of the activists were representative of the Mexican American population.
  The author suggests that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the US was not enough to assume an increase in political activism of the population.
  Therefore, the passage does not support options A and E, which relate increased ethnic consciousness with higher rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization.
  The passage also does not support option C, which suggests that assimilation of Mexican Americans into US culture decreases ethnic consciousness.
  D could be a possible option since was discussed in the passage that Garcia exaggerates the degree of the extent to which views of the activists were representative of the Mexican American population.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the new generation of Mexican American leaders which was determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent.
  However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The author also mentions that a better understanding is needed to assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the statement that is supported by the passage is "Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large accounts in part for variations in ethnic consciousness."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the increase in the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States.
  The author notes that Garcia claims that this new generation of Mexican Americans were more politically active than their predecessors and determined to achieve full civil rights.
  However, the author argues that it is not clear whether this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The author also suggests that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States does not necessarily result in increases in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, it is possible that variations in "rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization" account for variations in ethnic consciousness.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Dunham not to become closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  They believed that data gathering can and must be conducted from an objective position of detachment.
  The passage argues that Dunham's success can be attributed to her approach of active participation in the dances, which enabled her to understand the techniques better and teach them to others.
  The author would most likely disagree with the colleagues' advice for Dunham and their belief in complete detachment for effective data gathering.
  Therefore, the answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The colleagues advised Katherine Dunham to not get too involved in the dances she was observing.
  The author indicates that her immersion allowed her to comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices.
  The author also indicates that she learned the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  The author seems to disagree with the advice given to Dunham.
  Therefore, the answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Dunham not to participate actively in the dances she was observing.
  This advice was based on two reasons: (1) the risk of injury and (2) the necessity of complete detachment for scientific inquiry.
  Dunham chose to participate in the dances herself and her approach to research diverged from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  Therefore, the author might disagree with the colleagues' advice.
  Answer: C
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dunham as having a different approach to research than what was common at the time of her work.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham against her approach to research.
  Dunham's approach to research helped her to better understand the dances and learn the techniques.
  The author of the passage does not agree with the advice given by Dunham's colleagues.
  Based on this information, the best answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Dunham to maintain a position of complete detachment during data collection of the Caribbean dance forms.
  Dunham ignored the advice and participated in the dances herself.
  Her approach allowed her to comprehend the cultural practices better and learn the techniques to teach others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  The author most likely disagrees with the colleagues' advice to maintain detachment during data collection.
  Therefore, the answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The colleagues recommended that Dunham should not get too involved in the dances or become too closely involved.
  According to the passage, Dunham did not follow this recommendation and instead participated in the dances herself.
  The passage does not state that the colleagues were justified in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection or that injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  The passage does not discuss any change in Dunham's skill in performing Caribbean dances over time.
  The passage suggests that Dunham diverged from the colleagues' methodology and that prolonged immersion was effective for Dunham in comprehending various dances as complex cultural practices.
  There is no information to support the idea that the colleagues assumed that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  There is no information in the passage to suggest that the colleagues deemed dance to be less worthy of scientific study than other areas of ethnology.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Dunham to avoid participating too much in the dances she was observing.
  The author mentions that she tended to ignore this advice.
  The author states that Dunham's way of immersion was successful.
  The author implies that the colleagues' approach - not participating in the dances - was not as effective as Dunham's immersion.
  The closest answer choice is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The colleagues advised Katherine Dunham to maintain detachment while observing the dances she was researching.
  Katherine Dunham's research methodology diverged from that which prevailed at the time, she typically eschewed their advice and participated in the dances herself.
  The author praises Dunham's approach and gives evidence that her personal investment in fieldwork enhanced her work. 
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with statement C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The colleagues advised Dunham to keep distance from the dances she was studying.
  Dunham disregarded this advice and participated in the dances herself.
  Dunham's participation and immersion in the dances allowed her to learn and comprehend the dances as complex cultural practices.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but the author clarifies that this point of view is no longer recognized as realistic.
  The colleagues were partly correct in advising caution, but that did not prove to be accurate based on Dunham's success.
  The author does not suggest anything regarding their assumptions about the scientific rigor, objectivity of research in social sciences, or dance studies.
  Answer choice C suggests that "extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.", however, the author does not make this argument. 
  The answer is B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to participate in the dances she was observing and to remain detached.
  The author of the passage diverges from the methodology preached by the colleagues.
  Based on this, we can eliminate choices (A) and (B) as the author does not agree or support the advice given by the colleagues.
  The passage acknowledges the fact that the detached method of data collection is less productive and Dunham's method of participation in the dances has worked for her.
  The author specifically mentions that "the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment." 
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that accuses the colleagues of being incorrect in assuming detached research as the only effective data gathering method.

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author mentions that digital publication eliminates costs associated with storing, shipping, displaying, and returning printed books. 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" indicates that there are multiple types of costs being eliminated. 
  Based on this, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" is in reference to a cost that is irrelevant to digital publication.
  The author lists several costs that are eliminated under digital publication, such as warehousing and shipping of physical books. 
  Therefore, it can be inferred that "whole categories of expense" must refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  The answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author discusses how digital publishing decreases costs compared to traditional publishing.
  The author also highlights that digital publishing eliminates specific costs associated with the retail trade in traditional printed books such as "warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers."
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" likely refers to this broader category of costs that traditional publishing incurs but digital publishing does not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage states that "the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product." 
The sentence implies that something has been eliminated, which implies that these categories of expenses were present before.
Lines 17-19 describe the costs of traditional publishing, including printing books, shipping books to wholesalers, and retail stores, and displaying physical books in stores
Therefore, the author is using "whole categories of expense" to refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to a cost that is now eliminated under the digital publishing model.
Lines 26-29 state that digital publishing eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. 
Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The phrase "whole categories of expense" is mentioned as a part of the advantages of digital publishing. 
The author mentioned line 16-28 to explain those advantages specifically, including the elimination of physical inventory, warehouse, shipping, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers. 
Therefore, the "whole categories of expense" refer to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, which include the fees for warehouse, shipping, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books to publishers. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of digital publishing means that certain costs are eliminated or reduced.
  The author refers to "whole categories of expense" in this context.
  The expenses are not related to the fees of literary agents or the royalties paid to authors.
  The passage specifically mentions that the costs of printing, selling, distributing physical books, displaying them in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers are eliminated or reduced.
  Those costs are the "whole categories of expense" that the author is referring to.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:  
  The author talks about the elimination of several costs that are irrelevant to digital publication.
  The author uses this phrase to contrast it with the traditional publishing model.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Both passages describe what jury nullification is and discuss whether it is a good or bad thing.
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic because juries are not required to explain their verdicts, they often do not have enough information to make a reasoned decision, and they are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be helpful in cases where police and prosecutors are overzealous, or when laws are too broad or unjust.
  Neither passage mentions the level of bias in elected officials compared to jurors.
  Passage A argues that juries do not have the authority to interpret the law, while Passage B argues that juries can point out problems with laws.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against the power of the Jury to nullify due to several reasons, such as juries have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, juries often use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones, jurors are not legislators, and juries are unelected, unaccountable, and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others.
  Passage B argues in favor of the power of the Jury to nullify and how it can be useful, for example, by acting as a safety valve when police and prosecutors are overzealous, or assisting the legislature by indicating a problem with the law.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. Passage A argues that juries are not legislators and are not elected or accountable to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Passage B argues that juries can use their discretion to decide that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating or that a law is unjust. Thus Passage B implies that they are interpreting the law, whereas Passage A argues that is the responsibility of judges and elected officials.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A is against the idea of jury nullification due to several reasons provided in this passage while Passage B views it as a safety valve and more useful in some cases.
  From the given choices, the authors of the passages would most likely disagree over the idea of whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it because both passages have opposite views and opinions regarding this particular option. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that juries should not have the power to nullify.
  Passage B argues that allowing juries to nullify has important benefits.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree over whether juries should have the power to nullify.
  The correct answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The first passage argues that jury nullification is problematic.
  The second passage argues that the jury can act as a "safety valve."
  The first passage argues that the jury has no obligation to think through the effect of an acquittal.
  The second passage argues that when a jury nullifies it assists the legislature.
  The authors would most likely disagree over the idea that the jury's power of nullification is problematic or helpful.
  They would not likely disagree over the other ideas presented in the answer choices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that jury nullification is problematic for several reasons.
  Passage B argues that jury discretion can serve as a safety valve and can provide useful feedback to the legislature when laws are unjust.
  Both passages have different views on the usefulness and drawbacks of jury discretion, particularly in the context of nullification.
  The passages do not address police and prosecutors' discretion.
  Therefore, the authors do not disagree on whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
  The authors disagree on the appropriate role and extent of jury discretion, so the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that jury nullification can be problematic for three reasons but does not express an opinion as to whether juries should be allowed or not to nullify.
  On the other hand, Passage B argues that the act of nullification can sometimes be viewed as useful and perform a role, as a "useful function vis-a-vis the legislature".
  The passages do not directly disagree on any of the choices given.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The main idea of Passage A is to argue why jury nullification has problems like the inconsistency of verdicts, insufficient evidence to make nullification decisions, and juries' lack of accountability. Therefore, the authors would not likely agree to D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. 
  On the other hand, the main argument of Passage B is that juries can act as a safety valve and use their discretion to decide whether the violation of the law is trivial or circumstances are extenuating and whether a law is unjust. Therefore, the authors would not likely agree to E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue. 
  Furthermore, both passages assert that the legislature creates the law, and the jury has different functions than the elected officials. Thus, the authors would likely agree to B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people. 
  Although both passages have a different perspective from each other about the jury's power, they do not mention whether juries should be more forthcoming about their verdicts or whether elected officials are more biased than jurors. So, the authors' disagreement on A and C is not clear.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A states that juries are unaccountable and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. This suggests that the author of Passage A would disagree with the idea that juries should have the power to interpret the law.
  Passage B suggests that jury nullification can be used to alert the legislature to problems with a law and assist them in refining it. This suggests that the author of Passage B would disagree with the idea that the power of juries to nullify is unimportant.
  None of the other choices are directly addressed by the passages.
  Therefore, the answer is between options (D) and (E)
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A argue against the power of jury nullification, stating the problems that result from this power.
  The author of Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification, stating the benefits and how it can assist the legislature.
  Based on this, the authors are likely to disagree over whether the power of jury nullification is beneficial or problematic.
  Choice D appears to present their disagreement.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Response 0:

  - how Molina and Rowland showed the link between CFCs and depletion of the ozone layer
  - how they became advocates for public policy changes
  - how their work was criticized before it was accepted
  - how the international community developed a plan to ban CFCs
  Based on the information provided in the passage, the most strongly supported statement is:
  - Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  The passage mentions that CFCs have been banned since the late 1970s in North America, leading to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals. The passage also mentions the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which is an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. Therefore, Statement D is incorrect since it only mentions North America and not the international agreement that was established. Statement A is incorrect since there is no information in the passage to support this statement. Statement C is mentioned but is not the most strongly supported statement in the passage. Statement E is mentioned but does not focus on how the refrigerant chemicals are related to CFCs. Only Statement B is the most strongly supported since it focuses on the impact of CFC substitutes on the amount of chlorine released into the stratosphere.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author discusses the benefits and drawbacks of patenting biotechnology.
  The author suggests that patents incentivize innovation and, in reality, it's unlikely they would be enforced against academic researchers conducting basic and noncommercial research.
  The author also discusses the concerns that restrictions on access to patented materials are hindering basic research.
  Based on this, the author would most likely agree with choice C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The author seems to believe that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research as patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
The cost of patent litigation is likely to make sure patent holders will not prevent researchers from conducting basic and non-commercial research.
Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with choice C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The article dismisses the idea that patenting biotechnology will hinder basic research.
The author argues that patent law provides economic incentives to scientists to innovate.
The author also highlights the benefits of patent law in helping biotechnology industries secure intellectual property protection.
Option A is not true as the author never states that the reason that early researchers freely shared their research materials was that they couldn't protect their intellectual property.
Option B is not true. The author never mentions excessive fees, only that owners of patented materials may charge for access.
Option D is not true. The article mentions academic researchers' reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results; however, the author does not express any negative sentiment regarding this.
Option E is not relevant to the article, as the argument presented appears to be based on the idea that intellectual property protection provides economic incentives that drive biotechnology researchers' innovation. It does not relate to the question of whether researchers' work is innovative enough to qualify for patent protection.
Option C is true according to the article.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The author discusses the potential negative effects of biotechnology patenting on basic research.
The author argues that granting a patent does not necessarily mean denying access and that patents can actually spur innovation.
Option A is irrelevant in the context of the passage.
Option B, while consistent with some of the concerns raised by the author, is a generalization that is not explicitly made in the passage.
Option C is somewhat consistent with the author's argument that patent litigation is expensive and that enforcing patents against non-commercial research is unlikely, but it is not explicitly made in the passage.
Option D is inconsistent with the passage, as the author argues that biotechnology researchers' reliance on funding partially contingent on patentability is a reason why they increasingly support intellectual property protection.
Option E is not supported by the passage and is actually contradicted by the author's argument that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
Therefore, the best answer is C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author discusses the concerns of researchers regarding intellectual property protection.
  The author argues that some researchers fear that the patenting of biological materials will result in restrictions on access to such materials, which will hinder basic research.
  However, the author argues that these concerns are unfounded as the patent holder can't prevent the researcher from doing basic research.
  The author argues that patents will provide incentives to innovate and thus spurs basic research.
  Hence, the author would most likely agree with the statement that "The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
The author argues against the idea that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access.
The author argues that a patent will spur, rather than hinder, basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
The author argues that there is a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The author argues for the importance of biotech patents giving scientists an incentive to innovate. The author also expresses skepticism about claims that patenting hinders basic research and suggests that many of the criticisms stem from misunderstandings of patent rights and their limitations. Given this, the author would most likely agree with a statement that supports patent rights and argues against claims that they are overly restrictive on basic research.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author says that patenting biotechnology will not result in the patent holder to enjoin further research through legal action for patent infringement, which means the researchers opposing biotechnology patents are confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials.
  The author also says that patent litigation is expensive and exclusive to patent holders.
  Based on this, the author is likely to agree that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:

Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Thought:
The question is asking for information to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
The passage explains that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
Therefore, the new chemical should not chemically react with ozone or chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The question asks about an experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage details how CFCs harm the ozone layer, and that Molina and Rowland conducted an experiment that showed how CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  Therefore, if the chemical can replace CFCs without attacking the ozone layer, it should not contain chlorine that goes on to break down the ozone layer.  
  Chlorine is the most significant pollutant of the ozone layer, as the passage details how chlorine is the primary chemical that reacts with ozone in the stratosphere.
  So, testing whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether it could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer. 
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  CFCs are harmful to the ozone layer because they chemically react with the ozone and release chlorine, which damages the ozone layer.
  To determine whether a chemical is a good replacement, we need to test whether it would have a similar reaction with the ozone or produce any harmful by-products, such as chlorine.
  Option A deals with testing whether a chemical reacts with forms of oxygen other than ozone, which is not relevant.
  Option B deals with testing whether a chemical reacts with other chemicals commonly found in the lower atmosphere, which may not provide useful information about the chemical's effect on the ozone layer.
  Option C deals directly with testing whether a chemical would chemically react with chlorine, which is useful because the release of chlorine is a primary mechanism driving the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Options D and E may provide useful information, but they are not as directly relevant to the question as Option C.
  Therefore, the answer is Option C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment would help determine if a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, could chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Any replacement for CFCs must not attack and deplete the ozone layer in a similar manner.
  Therefore, the relevant experiment in addressing the potential for harm to the ozone layer is determining whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine.
  Hence, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question is asking us which experiment would help determine whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage states that CFCs attack and deplete the ozone layer chemically.
  The passage also states that chlorine chemically reacts with ozone, which destroys the ozone.
  Therefore, in order to determine whether a new chemical might replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, one would want to know if the new chemical will react with or form any chemicals that would harm the ozone layer.
  Choice C would satisfy the criteria by directly testing whether the new chemical would react with the harmful chlorine or not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The CFCs break down into constituent elements, including chlorine, which leads to an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Based on this information, testing to see whether a replacement chemical would chemically react with chlorine, which is one of the constituent elements of CFCs, would be the most useful experiment in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: To determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, it would be most useful to examine the chemical's impact on the ozone layer and its constituents if and when the chemical is released into the atmosphere. 
  The passage highlights how highly volatile chemicals such as CFCs can chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer by breaking down into their constituent elements including chlorine, which in turn reacts with ozone and regenerates chlorine atoms thereby destroying the ozone. Therefore, it is likely that a chemical's reaction to or interaction with chlorine, given its detrimental impact on the ozone layer, would be a crucial consideration in determining whether a replacement for CFCs could be identified without damaging the ozone layer. 
  Options A, B, D, and E may be relevant considerations for identifying a replacement for CFCs in terms of a chemical's properties and behavior when released into the atmosphere. However, given the direct link between CFCs and the depletion of the ozone layer, determining whether a replacement will harm the ozone layer is a priority. 
  Therefore, the most useful experiment to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer would be testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question is asking for the information yielded by which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation resulting in severe environmental threats.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was established to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases and develop more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals to replace CFCs.
  To determine whether a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, it's essential to understand the chemical traits of ozone-depleting gases.
  It's mentioned in the passage that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation in the lower atmosphere, react with other chemicals commonly found there, and chemically react with the ozone layer.
  Therefore, we can infer that testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The passage further explains that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, when subjected to ultraviolet radiation, and that the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, in order to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, it would be most useful to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment is most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions that CFCs damage the ozone layer by chemically attacking and depleting the ozone.
  In order to determine whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, an experiment must be conducted to ensure that the chemical could not attack and deplete the ozone layer chemically.
  Therefore, testing to see whether the chemical would chemically react with ozone (the chemical attacked by CFCs) would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought: 
  According to Passage A, scientists usually need additional auxiliary premises when deriving a theory's prediction.
  These premises make predictions testable by working correctly and eliminating disturbing forces.
  Popper argues that the search for negative evidence (disturbing forces) is at the heart of scientific research.
  According to Passage B, the auxiliary assumption that there were no other planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus made the prediction of its orbit incorrect. 
  Therefore, the existence of another planet close enough to Uranus is considered a disturbing force in this context.
Actions: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  According to Passage A, auxiliary premises appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. 
  In Passage B, when the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions, which appealed to the absence of disturbing forces.
  Therefore, one of the choices in Passage B might be an example of a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Disturbing force was described as one of the "auxiliary" premises in passage A.
  In passage B, one of the "auxiliary" assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the orbit of Uranus was not as predicted, the astronomers changed their assumptions about other planets in the vicinity.
  One possible explanation for this failure was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, one of the auxiliary assumptions about the absence of planets in the vicinity of Uranus could be considered a disturbing force.
  Answer: B, the sun, is not a possible answer because it is not an auxiliary assumption.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains that a theory rarely entails predictions on its own. Scientists almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises for the correct functioning of instrumentation, absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Passage B talks about the prediction of the orbit of Mercury. Scientists predicted the orbit using Newton's laws based on some auxiliary assumptions. 
  The passage also mentions that the predictions were not borne out. The scientists hypothesized the existence of a planet, Vulcan, in the vicinity to rectify their calculations. However, Vulcan was never discovered.
  Therefore, it is possible that there was a disturbing force that caused the predictions to fail. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The context of the question is based on Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science.
  Scientists make predictions based on a theory and auxiliary assumptions.
  One possible explanation for the failure of predictions is a disturbing force, such as the existence of another planet.
  In Passage B, scientists predicate the orbit of Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The failure of their predictions led them to change the auxiliary assumptions about the existence of other planets.
Action: Answer("C")  
The correct choice is C: Neptune because its existence near Uranus is suspected as disturbing force and changes the original prediction.
Response 5:
Thought:
  To answer questison we need to find an example of a disturbing force.
  Disturbing force is mentioned in Passage A (line 26) as one of the "auxiliary" premises.
  Planets close to Uranus create a disturbing force that causes a deviation from the predicted orbit.
  This is shown when astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus but found it was incorrect.
  They base this prediction on auxiliary assumptions which in this case is that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  They had to change this assumption and conclude that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Later, they discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place.
  The passage does not provide any evidence that indicates the existence of a disturbing force. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  For Popper, a failed prediction means that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one (lines 30-31).
  In Passage B, when the predictions about the orbits of Uranus and Mercury failed, there was more than one possible explanation (lines 36-40).
  One of the possible explanations for failed predictions was "an error in the auxiliary assumption" (line 38).
  The auxiliary assumption refers to other theories, to the functioning of instrumentation, and to the absence of disturbing forces (lines 21-24).
  Therefore, the correct answer must be something that can be qualified as a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("E") - the moon
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks to identify an example in passage B that shows a disturbing force as described in passage A.
  In passage A, it is mentioned that "additional 'auxiliary' premises" is needed to derive a theory's prediction.
  In passage B, auxiliary assumptions were made about the mass of the sun and planets.
  These assumptions can be considered as auxiliary premises.
  The incorrect predictions of Uranus and Mercury orbit can be due to a false assumption made about a premise or a disturbing force.
  Therefore, the answer may be either of "the sun", "Neptune" or "the moon" if they are mentioned as a reason for these failed predictions.
Action: Answer("B") 
The best answer is B: the sun, as the auxiliary assumption made about the mass of the sun was an incorrect premise that led to an incorrect prediction for Uranus orbit.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The disturbing force is mentioned in Passage A as one of the "diverse additional 'auxiliary' premises" on which predictions made by other theories depend.
  In Passage B, astronomers based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits and velocities of other planets.
  When the observations were made, the orbit that they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect, and planetary existence was one of the auxiliary assumptions they changed.
  Therefore, if the astronomers made any additional auxiliary assumptions, it would be to fix the observations of the planet's orbits.
  The moon is part of the solar system and does not affect the orbit of any planet.
  From Passage B, the sun was one of the auxiliary assumptions astronomers made when predicting the orbit of Uranus.
  Neptune was found in the precise place it would have to be to bring astronomers' calculations into alignment with observations, and there is no mention of it being an auxiliary assumption that had to be changed to fix the calculation.
  Mercury had a predicted orbit by astronomers, and the predictions were not borne out, which led them to hypothesize the existence of another planet in the vicinity called Vulcan.
  However, Vulcan was never found.
  If Vulcan was a disturbing force, then it would be an auxiliary assumption that had to be changed to fix the calculations, and they would not have hypothesized its existence.
  Therefore, neither the sun, Uranus, Neptune, Mercury, nor the moon appears to be a disturbing force in passage B.

Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position on the debate between literary critics in his time regarding the role of art.
  According to the passage, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was essential for literature.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality included both tangible and intangible aspects of life.
  The passage indicates that Dostoyevsky viewed the fantastic as an important aspect of literature and that it should be intimately bound up with reality.
  Dostovysky would not agree with the radical critics' position that art needs to serve a particular political view or that it must be useful.
  Based on these points, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the view that "art should stand high above the present and everyday" if it implies that literature should have no connection to the realities of life.
  Answer: C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky took a third position.
  The author argues that Dostoyevsky's view of reality went beyond the view held by radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky thought that reality was not necessarily what was tangible or limited to the mundane, and that there was no principled distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real. 
  Based on these it can be concluded that Dostoyevsky would not support the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Choices A, B, and D express ideas that align with Dostoyevsky's beliefs.
  Choice C is not supported by Dostoyevsky's view that there was no principled distinction between fantasy and reality.
  Choice E is consistent with Dostoyevsky's criticism of the utilitarian claim that a literary work must be useful. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage explains Dostoevsky's view on literary criticism.
  Dostoevsky took a distinct position from the other Russian literary critics.
  The question asks about Dostoevsky's agreement with a specific view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday. 
  The passage does not explicitly state Dostoevsky's agreement or disagreement regarding this position.
  However, since Dostoevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics because for him there was no distinction, in principle, between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible, it can be inferred that Dostoevsky would disagree with the position that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes three positions taken by Russian critics on the role of literature.
  Dostoyevsky took a distinct position and rejected some elements of both positions taken by the critics.
  The question is asking about the position taken by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The passage does not state that Dostoyevsky agreed with this position.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' positions that reality must be depicted "as it is" and that literature should only be useful.
  He believed that reality was more than just the tangible and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world with the fantastic.
  He also believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck him as a contradiction in terms.
  Answer Choice E reaffirms the radical critics' insistence that art must be useful to society and it is the opposite of what Dostoyevsky believed was unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would most likely have disagreed with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains Dostoyevsky's view on art and literature.
  The passage mentions that there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism at that time.
  One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position on the matter.
  He believed that reality was the crucial source of literature and that art must be artistic, meaning it must express thoughts in characters and images and must be able to write well.
  He also believed that literature and art should not be used for any particular political view or to serve any useful purpose.
  It is not clear from the passage which of the statements Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with.
  Statements that he would disagree with include: art standing high above the present and everyday, making no distinction between reality and fantasy, and insisting that art further some societal end.
  However, the passage also mentions that for Dostoyevsky, reality was far more than the merely tangible, and that within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed that the correct statement about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday is A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky took a third position different from the radical critics who maintained that art should be useful or serve a political purpose.
  To Dostoyevsky, the radical critics' insistence that art must stand high above the present and everyday and that it be useful to people and society were unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, the passage provides no evidence that Dostoyevsky would agree or disagree with a specific statement about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky took a third position.
  Among the opposing positions in Russian literary criticism, one argued that art should stand high above the present and everyday, while another argued it should have a strong connection with the tangible reality.
  Dostoyevsky's view on reality went deeper than the one prevailing amongst radical critics, there was no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The utilitarian claim that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art a shameful destiny.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistic talent as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the author's thoughts are fully understood.
  Based on these ideas, Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the requirement that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  So, he would not agree with choice A, B, C and D because they support this idea either partly or completely.
  Finally, he would most likely agree with the statement that emphasizes the utilitarian nature of art (with respect to the political or societal end), which appeared to him unsatisfactory.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky's own position on literature was somewhat different and he disagreed with both of the other views.
  He believed that reality is the crucial source of literature, but his understanding of reality was deeper than the radical critics.
  Moreover, Dostoyevsky's definition of artistry is that the novelist possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is simply the ability to write well.
  He opposed the view that literature should be useful to serve a particular political purpose.
  It can be inferred from these points that he would most likely have disagreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  Therefore, the answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question is asking about Dostoyevsky's opinion about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  According to the passage, Dostoyevsky took a third position, and he believed reality should be the crucial source of literature, but reality was more than just the tangible.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the radical critics' view that literature should be useful to society.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky most likely disagreed with the view that art should stand high above the present and everyday, as it is an unrealistic view of reality.
  The answer is "It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky had a different view from the radical critics who believed that art should be useful.
  The passage also explains that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source.
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky believed that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality is far more than the merely tangible.
  Dostoyevsky had issues with the radical critics' view of art and reality and their insistence that art must further some societal end.
  The passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky would agree with any of the statements.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage defines "discretionary nonenforcement" (line 20) as the opposite of capricious enforcement. 
  Therefore, if the passage describes an instance of capricious enforcement, it likely involves not selecting cases according to principle.
  From the passage, it appears that legislative oversight helps prevent the agencies from straying too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Thus, it seems unlikely that instances of capricious enforcement would involve not following the legislature's intent or prioritizing enforcement based on the amount of damage caused by the crime.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes discretionary nonenforcement as a technique to reduce the costs of overinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is the opposite of what legislative oversight assures.
  This means that capricious enforcement involves ignoring the intended regulation and enforcing the law according to some other criteria, which suggests that it involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A defines discretionary nonenforcement technique.
  Passage A argues that legislature's rule of law is over-inclusive which means it forbids some conduct that it did not want to forbid.
  Passage A argues enforcing an over-inclusive rule to the letter can impose heavy social costs.
  Passage A argues discretionary nonenforcement technique reduces the costs of overinclusion without a corresponding increase in underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement refers to an unjust or unfair enforcement of the law.
  The central tendency of law enforcement is not capricious.
  Legislative oversight prevents law enforcement agencies from straying too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned in Passage A
  According to Passage A, legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  This implies that capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that enforcement of over-inclusive laws can lead to heavy social costs and punishment of innocent people, while the opposite would create loopholes in the laws.
  The non-enforcement technique, while providing an illusion of discretion, is mostly organized in compliance with the legislative oversight to not deviate far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement must be in opposition to following the intent of the legislature.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. (lines 28-32)
  Therefore, capricious enforcement involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement refers to enforcement done randomly, without reasons or principles.
  The passage suggests that discretionary nonenforcement, rather than capricious enforcement, is a more common and acceptable practice.
  The passage also suggests that legislative oversight assures that the enforcement agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement and its advantages for enforcing laws appropriately.
  Line 32 references that capricious enforcement is not unknown or rare.
  Capricious enforcement could mean enforcing laws without a principle or ignoring the legislatures' oversight.
  Capricious enforcement could also imply not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author of Passage A is discussing the use of discretionary nonenforcement as a method to reduce the costs of overinclusive laws.
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned as an unlikely scenario.
  Capricious enforcement is also described as uncommon, but not a rare occurrence.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely refers to an instance where the law is enforced without following the intent of the legislature or without any rational reason for doing so.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned in the passage.
  The passage describes that the use of discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases, but capricious enforcement is not unknown or even rare.
  The passage states that legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement goes against the oversight of the legislature in assuring that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement would most likely involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle is used to reconcile different positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains that the principle helps to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses an economic principle, utility maximization, that is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice
  According to the principle, a person will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds that of engaging in lawful activity
  Increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement increase the cost of detection and punishment, thereby lowering the expected utility from criminal activity
  Similarly, increasing economic opportunities effectively increases the expected utility from lawful activity
  The passage uses an analogy to show that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both strategies
Action: Answer("D") 
  The use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate. Just as legal scholars utilize a principle from economics, scholars from another field of study, anthropology, provide evidence to support a legal decision.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses legal scholars' use of the economic principle of the utility maximization to address the crime deterrence debate.
  It is asking for a scenario similar to this use of the economic principle.
  The examples provided in the choices do not seem relevant to the passage.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices is appropriate.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes how the utility maximization principle reconciles two sides of the crime deterrence debate.
  This principle suggests that people make rational economic choices based on expected utilities.
  The expected utility is based on weighing the utilities of possible outcomes and the likelihood of those outcomes occurring.
  The legal scholars use this principle to argue that increasing fines and penalties, or increasing economic opportunities, affect the expected utility of committing a crime and deter crime. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Legal scholars are using the utility maximization principle to analyze the rationality behind an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  They are using an economic principle to show the complementarity of both deterrence methods.
Action: Answer("D")  
Based on the passage, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case. Just as the judge uses evidence to support their decision, legal scholars are using an economic principle to support their viewpoints on deterrence methods.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The crime deterrence debate is aimed at reducing the number of deliberate crimes.
  The two sides of the debate disagree on the source of deliberate crime and the most effective way to deter it.
  One side believes that changing societal norms, increasing economic opportunity, and rehabilitating convicts will deter deliberate crime.
  The other side believes that the deterrence of deliberate crime is accomplished by increasing fines and punishments for criminal activity.
  Recent legal scholarship teaches that the positions of both sides are complementary.
  The principle that makes these positions compatible is that of utility maximization.
  Utility maximization holds that rational people select the action that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the weighted utilities of punishment and reward.
  The use of utility maximization by legal scholars to reconcile the two sides of the crime deterrence debate is similar to a situation where a person borrows a principle from one field and applies it to solve a problem outside the original field.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage is discussing a way to reconcile two sides of the debate about how to deter deliberate crimes. 
  This is done by using an economic principle called utility maximization. 
  Utility maximization involves analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The strategy of deterrence includes elements of both deterrence strategies and aims at reducing the expected overall satisfaction from committing crimes.
  None of the answer choices seems to describe a scenario that is similar to legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate. 
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks for the scenario most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  The passage explains how the principle is used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime.
  The purpose of using the utility maximization principle is to show how the two positions on deterring deliberate crimes are complementary.
  None of the choices mentions a principle being used to reconcile two opposing views.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle as a means to understand the rational decision making of those who commit crimes.
  This concept is suggested to resolve the debate on how best to deter crime, either through societal changes or through increased penalties and law enforcement.
  Legal scholars are the ones who utilize this principle.
  Therefore, legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is most similar to D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks which scenario is most similar to the use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate.
  According to the passage, the utility maximization principle shows that rational individuals committing a crime will do so if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The passage also explains that the recommendations of increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement and the other position of increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions affect the utility equation. 
  The use of the principle in the crime deterrence debate is similar to using a law from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other since both use a principle from another field to provide evidence towards an argument.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The discovery of uranium fission took a long time since researchers lacked the 'right conceptual link'.
  This suggests that having an appropriate 'conceptual link' would have helped researchers identify the significance of the data sooner.
  The passage discusses several factors that delayed the recognition of nuclear fission, including researchers' expectations, difficulty of chemical analyses, and others.
  Only B and C relate to the researchers' assumptions.
  Out of these, B seems more likely to have helped researchers, since it suggests that researchers did not pre-assume anything about the likely nuclear composition.
  On the other hand, option C suggests researchers were not aware of the in-principle possibility of atom-splitting, which may have been a cognitive barrier to recognizing evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks which of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  According to the passage, one reason why the physicists failed to identify nuclear fission earlier is because they did not even recognize the possibility of it happening with neutron-bombardment experiments targeting uranium.
  Thus, it is likely that if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were made more aware of the possibility of splitting atoms, they might have identified nuclear fission earlier.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the problem because it does not have any direct impact on identifying nuclear fission.
  Choice B does not make sense based on the passage because the physicists did not recognize the possibility of splitting atoms in the first place.
  Choice C contradicts the statement made in the passage that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Choice D may actually have the opposite effect. If more physicists focused on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium, it may lead to further confusion without any clear conceptual link to explain the results.
  Therefore, Choice E, which suggests to conduct neutron bombardment experiments on other substances, might expose physicists to a wider range of experimental results, which might help them recognize the possibility of splitting atoms. The correct answer is E. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discussed how the discovery of nuclear fission had occurred, which took several years before a crucial theoretical connection was made.
  The researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  The products of the experiments remained unidentified because they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication.
  It took a while to recognize what was happening because there was a lack of the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, something that could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would have been if they had the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before the theoretical connection was provided.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that splitting of atoms might happen.
  Meitner finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  It became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that if researchers conducted neutron bombardment experiments aimed at achieving the splitting of atoms and were receptive to the possibility that such a result might happen, the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would have been reduced.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the physicists "compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing."
  The reason why they were not recognizing it was not because of lack of experiments, but because they did not have the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, increasing evidence from more experiments would not be the most likely thing to reduce the amount of time it took physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice C, stating that physicists were not aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, does not make practical sense, as theorists were already producing these calculations at that time.
  Choice E, regarding experiments conducted in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, is irrelevant to the context of the passage.
  Therefore, the best answer should be choice B, which describes that the physicists conducting the experiments had no particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The discovery of a means by which the nuclei of the atoms can be split took whooping 5 years to be realized.
  The main reason why the physicists took so long to realize what they were witnessing was that they had not identified the by-products of fission since they expected all the substances produced to be
elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  If the physicists did not have such expectations, they would have realised what was happening more quickly.
  Therefore, the option (B) is the most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The main reason why the physicists recognized nuclear fission much later after performing nuclear bombardment experiments was that they did not expect that nuclear fission would result from these experiments.
  Among the given choices, if physicists had no expectation for the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then this lack of the expectation could have possibly enabled the discovery of nuclear fission earlier.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that researchers were not receptive to the possibility of breaking apart atoms and were not even aware of the possibility.
  Lise Meitner was able to recognize the significance of the data and provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Theoretcal calculations had been produced earlier indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Thus, if the physicists had been aware of the theoretical calculations, the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split might have been reduced.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The discovery that nuclei of atoms can be split took several years because scientists overlooked the crucial hypothesis that was being presented before them.
  The neutron-bombardment experiment of Uranium by Fermi and others produced numerous substances which remained unidentified, but were thought to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting atomic nuclei.
  Therefore, if the physicists in neutron bombardment of uranium did not expect the present results from the experiment, the amount of time taken for physicists to realize that atomic nuclei were being split may have reduced.
  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium already had evidence of nuclear fission but they did not recognize it, so they need a certain conceptual link.
  Therefore, finding a conceptual link or someone who could see the connection based on the already existing evidence would most likely reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Among the given options,
  A is irrelevant to the problem since having the same research techniques does not change the physicists' conceptual link.
  B is also irrelevant since the passage already indicated that the divergence in the physicists' expectation did not affect their recognition.
  C is actually opposite to the fact that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  D is incorrect since getting more experimental results would not get them closer to the conceptual link.
  E is not mentioned in the passage or does not relate to the uranium experiments.
  Therefore, none of these options would be most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 66 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.
  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about three significant positions on Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintained that art stood high above daily life.
  The second position maintained that art must be useful to society.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position which claimed that the author must express his thoughts using characters and images to effectively convey them to the reader, and that art should not be limited by political or utilitarian concerns.
  Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage presents three different positions:
    1. Art stands above the present and the everyday.
    2. Art should be useful and contribute to a new society.
    3. Art must combine reality and fantasy and possess artistic merit.
  The passage goes on to talk about Dostoyevsky's views and how they differ from the first two positions.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses three different positions on the purpose of literature.
  The first two positions are introduced as opposing views, while the third position is presented as a distinct and alternative perspective.
  The majority of the passage is spent describing the third position and contrasting it with the first two, which suggests that this is the main focus of the author.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three positions regarding Russian literary criticism.
  The first position holds that art should be high above the present and the everyday.
  The second position believes that art should exist only if it finds sources in concrete reality and contributes to creating a new society.
  The third position, which is held by Dostoyevsky, is a realist approach that goes deeper than the second position.
  The third position believes in reality beyond tangible and that the writer should explode the boundaries of the real world.
  The writer should not be concerned with any particular political view; instead, a literary work must stand or fall only on its artistic merit.
  Dostoyevsky defines artistry as the ability to write well and the writer's talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts.
  Finally, the writer should not be concerned with art being useful to people and society because sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose, but it may have paths that lead to become useful.
  The best description of the organization of the material is that "Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage presents three positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The third position taken by Dostoyevsky is explained in detail.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality is defined in contrast to the first two positions.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of artistic merit is explained in contrast to the utilitarian view.
  The passage does not indicate that the third position taken by Dostoyevsky is superior or inferior to the other positions.
  Therefore, the best choice is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three different positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The first position emphasizes the importance of art being above the present and the everyday.
  The second position believes that literature should be useful and reflect the concrete reality of society.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, believes in the importance of using reality as the crucial source, but with a deeper understanding that includes fantasy and an abhorrence of the utilitarian purpose of art.
  The passage mainly explains the third position and how it differs from the first two.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions on Russian literary criticism.
  The first position emphasizes art being elevated above everyday life.
  The second position emphasizes art's responsibility to contribute to the creation of a new and just society.
  Dostoevsky's position is different from the first two positions. For Dostoevsky, reality can be shaped and influenced by individuals' experience and interpretation of it.
  Dostoevsky believes that a novelist's talent is his ability to express his thoughts in a way that readers can understand and fully comprehend.
  He opposes the idea that a literary work must be useful to society and should instead be judged only by its artistic merit.
  Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two positions in detail.
  The passage does not show that the third position is superior or inferior to the other two positions.

Thought: 
The passage clearly discusses the three different literary positions during Dostoyevsky's time and how Dostoyevsky's position differed from the other two.
The passage discusses the first two literary positions in the beginning.
The passage then discusses Dostoyevsky's position and what sets it apart from the other two positions. 
Therefore, the passage presents three positions and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 
The answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three positions on Russian literary criticism.
  The first position believed that literature should stand above the present and be separate from reality.
  The second position believed that literature should be rooted in concrete, present reality and serve a political end.
  The third position, which Dostoyevsky took, believed in realism, but went deeper than the second group in that reality was more than just what's tangible.
  The third position also believed in the intimate connection between the real and the fantastic.
  The third position also believed that artistry is the ability to write well, and that works of literature should stand or fall on artistic merit alone.
  The radical critics' insistence on utility to politics and society was seen as unsatisfactory.
  From this, we can infer that the overall organization of the passage is that it presents three positions and differentiates the third one from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage presents three significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  The first direction maintains that art should be high above the present and the everyday.
  The second direction maintains that art should be useful and find its sources in concrete reality.
  The third direction, taken by Dostoyevsky, holds that reality is the crucial source of literature, but that reality is far more than the merely tangible, and that reality is necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for him, reality is not just about exposing want and injustice, but rather it is about exploding the boundaries of the so-called real world, and exploring the fantastic that is intimately bound up with the real.
  Dostoyevsky also disagreed with the second direction that insisted that art must serve a particular political view, and that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The question asks which assertion from passage A most clearly exemplifies the author of passage B's claim that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory.
  According to passage B, evolutionary psychology postulates interests that drive behavior that the agent is not aware of.
  One assertion in passage A speaks about how genes may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Passage A thus implies that interests of genes are driving behavior, without acknowledging that the agent is aware of this.
  This assertion in Passage A is an example of how evolutionary psychology can be seen as a conspiracy theory.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage B considers evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that explains behavior in terms of propagating genes.
  In evolutionary psychology, altruism presents a problem to evolve, and the genes may help the expansion of themselves by provoking psychological experiences.
  Options A, B, C, and E are related to the discussion but do not clearly exemplify the claim.
  Option D states that the genes can indirectly help themselves propagate through actions like altruism, which resembles the conspiracy theory argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  Conspiracy theories explain behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not acknowledge or even is unaware of.
  Thus, what appears to be an interest in the well-being of a child turns out to be a gene's conspiracy to propagate itself.
  Therefore, a statement from passage A that best exemplifies this idea is one that mentions how genes promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Thus the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  It says that evolutionary psychology imputes an interest of the genes to promote self-propagation.
  This means that evolutionary psychology presents a theory that portrays the genes' action for self-propagation as a deliberate secret or conspiracy.
  Therefore, the assertion that genes can promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish from passage A is what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  A conspiracy theory imputes an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of.
  The author of passage B may object to evolutionary psychology because it attributes behavior to a genetic interest in propagating genes when there are other reasons that may explain the behavior.
  One such example of evolutionary psychology's interest may be calling altruism a mechanism that propagates genes selfishly.
  Therefore, the assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory could be D : Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  In Passage B, the author describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory for attributing genetic propagation interests to individuals even if the agent of the behavior is not aware of them.
  Passage A has several assertions related to evolutionary psychology.
  The assertion that most clearly exemplifies what the author of Passage B means is the one that refers to imputing an interest (genetic propagation) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or is not even aware of.
  This is best illustrated in the assertion that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory."
  Conspiracy theories often involve hidden or unacknowledged motives.
  The author of passage B argues that an interest in propagating one's genes may not be the only reason for certain behaviors.
  The assertion from passage A that best exemplifies this is the one in which the author explains how apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system.
  This argument is an example of how a behavior might be reasonable for reasons other than a concern to propagate one's genes.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for explaining human behavior by imputing genetic interests to individuals that are not aware of them.  
  The interest in promoting the welfare of one's children, for example, can be explained by an interest in doing so or by an interest in propagating one's genes.  
  The injection of genetic interests into the explanation is a kind of conspiracy to propagate genes.  
  Of the given options, choice D is the most clear instance of evolutionary psychology imputing genetic interests to individuals.  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question asks about an assertion in Passage A that exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  The passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it explains an individual's behavior by imputing an interest in the propagation of genes that the agent does not acknowledge or is unaware of.
  One assertion in passage A that exemplifies this idea is that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Although the explanation is reasonable, the application of this idea can sometimes be problematic.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author of passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  The author of passage A explains that evolutionary psychology explains human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals.
  Further, passage A explains that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  This indicates that evolutionary psychology seeks to find hidden interests and motivations behind human behavior.
  Hence, option D that explains how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish can be considered as the assertion that most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B refers to as a conspiracy theory.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is defined in the passage.
  According to the passage, most scholars have focused on "as-told-to life histories" of Native Americans which were written by non-Native American collaborators.
  These written documents emerged from "bicultural composite authorship."
  Scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history, which included oral autobiographies that comprised songs, chants, and stories, and even the process of repeatedly taking on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life.
  This means "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the written documents are a collaboration between non-Native American collaborators and Native Americans who provided their oral histories.
  Based on this, the answer is E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5 seems to refer to the mode of writing Native American autobiographies.
  According to the passage, most scholars of Native American autobiographies have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators, emerging from "bicultural composite authorship".
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" seems to refer to the idea that the life histories were written collaboratively by members of different cultures.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of life history that has been produced collaboratively by Native American individuals and non-Native American collaborators.
  Scholars have studied autobiographies of Native Americans, but they have primarily focused on written life histories that emerged from this "bicultural composite authorship."
  The collaboration and shared authorship of these written life histories have been overlooked by scholars, who have failed to consider other preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  Choice A refers to works that are based on artifacts and oral traditions, which are preliterate modes mentioned in the passage, but it does not specify collaboration between members of different cultures.
  Choice B refers to collaboration between two people but does not specify that they are from different cultures, so it does not accurately convey the meaning of "bicultural."
  Choice C is not supported by the passage, which describes how the collaborators can be identified as non-Native American.
  Choice D accurately conveys that one member of a different culture has edited and revised the work, but it does not specify that the work was originally written by a Native American.
  Choice E accurately conveys that a member of one culture wrote based on another member's oral communication, but it does not specify that the collaborator was a non-Native American.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is defined as it comes from the passage.
  Scholars have focused on "as-told-to" life histories.
  Scholars have only studied written documents and have overlooked traditional ways of communication.
  Any autobiography is a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to written documents that are obtained from a collaborative effort between Native Americans who shared their personal history (orally) and non-Native American who transcribed, edited, and translated the content.
  The best answer is E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is defined as the way in which most scholars have studied autobiographies of Native Americans.
  The passage mentions that these autobiographies were "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators" and that "they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples".
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that these autobiographies were created by non-Native American collaborators working with Native American individuals, resulting in a finished product that reflects both cultures.
  Based on this information, the most accurate definition of "bicultural composite authorship" is option D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  These life histories are a composite result of collaboration between Native American collaborators and non-Native American collaborators.
  Therefore, the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" means that the life histories represent a complex interaction between cultures and peoples. 
  From the given choices, the best option is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is a complex term. 
The paragraph focuses on Native American cultures. 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" likely refers to a process where a written document is produced based on collaboration between a Native American individual and a non-Native American collaborator. 
The paragraph provides additional information that scholars have overlooked traditional ways of communicating personal history. 
Therefore, the correct answer choice should reflect the process by which Native American autobiographies were produced by collaboration between individuals from two different cultures.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes how scholars have studied written autobiographies of Native Americans.
  Most of these written documents were a result of "bicultural composite authorship".
  The passage goes on to explain what this phrase means.
  Essentially, it refers to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The resulting written document, therefore, is a composite of two cultures.
  Choice (D) accurately describes this meaning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a specific type of written document.
  This type of document is a life history of a Native American, which is solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The phrase suggests that the authorship of the document is shared by people from two different cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is describing a process that includes different cultures.
It involves the collaboration of people from different cultures to create a written document.
The phrase is used to describe the "as-told-to" life histories of Native Americans.
These histories were recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
The phrase "composite authorship" suggests that there are multiple authors involved in creating the final written product.
The phrase "bicultural" suggests that there are two different cultures contributing to the process.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that there are problems associated with brain scans as pictures of mental activity.
  The modular theory of mind, which holds that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions, is not universally accepted.
  In the case of FMRI, a subtractive method is used, whereby one takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The passage does not suggest that the empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications. Similarly, the passage does not suggest that the subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity or that the method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain based on a fundamental misconception of the method. 
  Rather, the passage suggests that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and task conditions.
  It creates an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind. 
  However, the modular theory of mind is criticized later in the passage as being too simplistic and not accounting for the complexity of mental processes. 
  Therefore, the author would not support the idea that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of mind.
  The author also does not mention anything about medical applications of the subtractive method.
  The author does not agree that the subtractive method depicts the differential rates of oxygen use as its fundamental premise is to take the baseline metabolic activity as a control condition and subtract it from the metabolic activity in a task condition.
  Rather, the author uses the subtractive method as a way to criticize the modular theory of mind and argues that the method creates an illusion of localization of brain functions. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage introduces the subtractive method: a way of interpreting FMRI scans.
  The subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while a subject performs a cognitive task, producing striking images of localized brain activity.
  The subtractive method is problematic in that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The modular theory of mind, which claims that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions, may be misguided.
  The author suggests that Uttal's view of mental activity being distributed throughout the brain is more plausible.
  The passage does not suggest that empirical results derived using the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
  The passage also does not discuss brain scans produced using the subtractive method that specifically show emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
  Although the subtractive method creates an illusion of localized brain activity, the passage does not suggest that this supports the modular theory of mind.
  The statement that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use is based on a fundamental misconception is not supported by the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage provides a critique of the modular theory of mind, which claims that modular components of mental activity are said to be instantiated in distinct and separate parts of the brain.
  The passage further raises the point that the subtractive method, which depicts well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks, is a plausible but problematic way of localizing brain functions.
  The passage argues that the entire brain is active in both conditions, all mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The argument of the passage is against the modular theory of the mind, and hence, it does not seem to imply that the subtractive method supports the modular theory of the mind. 
  Also, the passage does not imply that the empirical results derived by the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications. Moreover, it does not address the localization of emotions in the amygdala.
  Therefore the answer is: A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The passage presents the subtractive method as a tool for creating images of the brain at work.
The method is used in FMRI scans.
The reasoning behind the use of this method is explained in the passage.
The author considers the subtractive method problematic.
The reason for the problem is that it creates the impression of neat functional localization, which contradicts the belief of the distributed nature of brain functions.
Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage describes the subtractive method, which is used in functional MRI.
The method subtracts a baseline measurement from a second measurement taken while the subject performs a cognitive task, producing images known as "maps" or "brain scans."
The passage argues that this subtractive method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
The author argues that this may create an illusion of neat functional localization, supporting the modular theory of mind.
The question asks which statement the author would agree with regarding the subtractive method.
Action: Answer("D")  
The author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the subtractive method works and describes how it gives an incomplete picture of brain activity.
  However, the author doesn't make any specific value judgments as to whether the subtractive method is good or bad.
  Moreover, the author mentions how the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage states that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work but produces an illusion of neat functional localization. It is also mentioned that the presence of the entire brain in both conditions is obscured by the subtractive method. Therefore, the author would most likely not agree with option A, B, C, or D. 
Option E seems unlikely as the passage describes that the subtractive method is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen used in different parts of the brain. And it further described the process of the subtraction.  However, the passage does not contain any information that subverts the idea that the subtractive method produces images that show differential rates of oxygen use in the brain. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
    The author presents the subtractive method as a tool for producing images of seemingly clean functional localization which masks the distributed brain functions.
    The author suggests that the fact that the entire brain is active in both the on-task and the control conditions is usually unremarked, pointing out how flawed this idea can be.
    The author, however, does not explicitly describe the validity or usefulness of the empirical data derived using this method.
    The author does not seem to agree with the modular theory of mind because it is not compatible with the suggestion that mental processes are essentially properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the subtractive method in the context of brain scans and its limitations.
  According to the passage, the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work but falsely localizes brain functioning.
  The passage does not mention any invalidation of empirical results for medical applications.
  Similarly, the passage does not suggest that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are properties of general mental activity.
  While the passage mentions the amygdala as a seat of emotion, it does not imply that the subtractive method shows that emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
  The passage suggests that the subtractive method gives an illusion of modular mind theory.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules.

But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage identifies that brain scans show well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks. 
  The passage further explains that the FMRI scan is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain - a measure of metabolic activity - and it depicts a differential rate of oxygen use.
  The approach of subtractive method in defining the metabolic activity associated with a cognitive task rather obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The passage mentions the modular theory of mind and its relation to brain scans, specifically FMRI.
FMRI shows activity in different parts of the brain during cognitive tasks.
The baseline measurement is subtracted from on-task measurement to produce images of "neat functional localization".
The passage, therefore, provides support for statement C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans for cognitive tasks.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise used to support the use of brain scans in cognitive studies.
  The passage critiques the validity of the modular theory of mind.
  FMRI is a subtractive method used to map the rate of oxygen use in cognitive tasks.
  The mapping of FMRI actually depicts differential rate of oxygen use.
  The entire brain is active in both control and on-task measurements.
  The subtractive method produces images of the active brain at work that illustrate the modular theory of mind.
  Based on the given information, the most strongly supported statement is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology.
  Brain scans of this type rely on the modular theory of mind, which states that different cognitive processes are associated with specific regions of the brain.
  However, the author critiques the modular theory of mind, arguing that it is likely that mental processes are distributed throughout the brain and not confined to specific modules.
  The passage discusses the subtractive method of brain scanning, which gives the impression of neat functional localization but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The passage does not strongly support choices A, B, D or E.
  The passage does support choice C, which explains that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain (due to the subtractive method).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes how the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind is criticized and described to misconstrue human experience.
  The passage also explains the subtractive method used to produce functional brain scans.
  The method produces images of localized brain activity, but may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in any cognitive tasks.
  Choice A is not supported by the passage. 
  Choice B is not supported by the passage.
  Choice C is supported by the passage. It describes the rate of oxygen use of areas most metabolically active during the performance of certain cognitive tasks.
  Choice D is not supported by the passage.
  Choice E is not supported by the passage. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  According to the passage, a brain scan is useful in medical diagnosis, but not in psychology.
  The use of neuroimaging in psychology is based on the modular theory of mind which asserts that the mind has separate and distinct modules, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  Some experts argue that mental activity cannot be decomposed into independent modules, rather it is distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage explains how the subtractive method using FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task condition.
  It is clear from the passage that the modular theory of mind is problematic when applied to psychology.
  The passage provides information about how brain scans are taken, but it does not provide support for any of the given statements.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
The passage talks about the modular theory of mind and functional MRI scans. It explains the method of using the subtractive method to produce images and explains a critique of modular theory. The passage also explains how the entire brain is active during both the control and cognitive task. 
Action: Answer("C")  
Statement C is mentioned in the passage with the explanation of functional MRI scans technique.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes the subtractive method used in FMRI scans to reveal well-defined areas that "light up", in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is that "During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a research method around a premise of the modular theory of mind.
  The modular theory of mind suggests that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  But, this premise is doubtful since mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Brain scans do reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks, and this is a result of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The FMRI subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to show metabolic activity in the regions of the brain.
  The brain scan shows a differential rate of oxygen use during the cognitive task and a high rate of metabolism that obscures all the distributed brain function.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the difference between using neuroimaging as a research method in psychology and for medical diagnosis.
  The modular theory of mind claims that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The critique of the modular theory is that various mental processes are not decomposable into independent modules but are properties of general mental activity throughout the brain.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues in favor of fingerprint identification as a generally reliable source of evidence in criminal trials.
  Passage B argues that there is a lack of standardization and objective criteria for fingerprint identification, which make it difficult to determine its reliability.
  The authors express opposing viewpoints on the reliability of fingerprint examination.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification in the criminal justice system.
  The likelihood of an examiner incorrectly declaring a match in a given case is discussed in Passage B, but not directly relevant to the main point of disagreement between the two authors.
  The other answer choices are not directly related to the authors' differing views on fingerprint identification. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been reliable despite not being a scientific law and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, whereas Passage B argues that there are no objective standards and no consensus about what constitutes sufficient basis for identification. 
  The authors of both Passages agree that some uniformity exists, as fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. 
  The authors also seem to agree on how often fingerprint examiners correctly declare a match, but they disagree on how often examiners mistakenly declare a match and the relative merits of certain methods of fingerprint identification. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B present differing views on the fingerprint identification process.
  Passage A emphasizes on the reliability of fingerprint identification and the existence of uniform standards.
  Passage B, on the other hand, highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and the absence of a specific number of similarity points required.
  Passage B also discusses the lack of knowledge regarding the chance of resemblance between individuals and the absence of a reliable error rate for fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the "likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case."
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable and has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B, on the other hand, criticizes fingerprint identification as lacking objective standards and having received little systematic study.
  The authors appear to disagree on the reliability and validity of fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
Passage A states that experts have long concurred about the reliability of fingerprint identification, that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, and that the trial court was within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
Passage B states that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
Passage A and B appear to disagree on the issue of whether there is a general agreement about the error rate for fingerprint identification. While Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, Passage B notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study but is likely higher than suggested by proficiency tests.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues in favor of the reliability of fingerprint evidence and rejects the defendant's argument that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match", and that this lack of standards makes it difficult to measure the value of fingerprint evidence.
  Both passages discuss fingerprint identification, but their main arguments and focus are different. 
  While Passage A discusses the reliability and consistency of fingerprint identification, Passage B focuses on the lack of uniformity and objective standards in the identification process. 
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the degree of uniformity and objectives standards that fingerprint examiners have. 
  The answer is A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A presents a positive perspective towards the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification.
  Passage B presents a skeptical perspective towards the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification by pointing out various issues and lack of consensus within the field of fingerprint identification.
  The authors of the two passages might disagree about a particular issue related to fingerprint identification.
  Answer (B) is a possible point of disagreement as Passage A mentions that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate while Passage B points out that there has been little systematic study about the error rate and that a more rigorous test has shown a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has an extremely low error rate, which has been achieved through consistent training and uniform standards established through peer review, and the court sees no reason to reject outright fingerprint evidence.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and criticizes the inconsistency in local practices and a lack of sufficient data and testing on error rates of fingerprint identification.
  The authors seem to disagree most on the reliability of fingerprint identification. Passage A suggests it is reliable enough to be admissible evidence, while Passage B suggests that there are significant limitations and errors in the current system.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the authors argue that fingerprint identification has been reliably used in criminal trials and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The passage does not raise any issue with the method used to identify fingerprints.
  In Passage B, the authors argue that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The passage also argues that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B differ in opinions regarding the standards of fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A emphasizes the reliability of the fingerprint identification, agreeing with the decision bellow, which held that the use of fingerprint identification evidence was supported by uniform standards and generally accepted to have an exceedingly low error rate.
  On the other hand, Passage B criticizes the lack of consensus in the scientific community on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and considers that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the error rate of fingerprint examiners, with Passage A supporting the idea that fingerprint identification has a low error rate, and Passage B presenting the results of a rigorous study that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.

Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage explores the idea that perfume is a form of art that is undervalued.
  It makes comparisons between the making of perfume and other forms of art such as painting and music.
  It talks about the formula development process used by perfumers which is similar to the work of painters.
  The passage also explains how smells can evoke memories and bring about an aesthetic experience.
  All of these points suggest that the passage supports the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains the similarities between the creation of oil paintings and perfumes.
  Just like painters, perfumers carefully combine different chemical compounds or pigments to create their art.
  Paintings change over time due to the property of oil paints to become gradually more transparent, while perfumes change over time because of the different rates at which the olfactory compounds evaporate.
  Thus, the writer indirectly suggests that perfumes can indeed bring about an aesthetic experience separate from that of paintings through their unique qualities.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author discusses the parallels between oil paintings and perfumes.
  The author claims that a brilliant perfumer may devise an imaginary world no less powerful or intimate than that of a great composer or painter.
  The author also mentions that the cynical bean counters in corporations tamper with old formulas for cheaper ingredients, hurting the perfume's quality.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for the statement that "A brilliant perfumer may devise an imaginary world no less powerful or intimate than that of a great composer or painter." 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage compares the creation of perfumes with that of paintings.
  Both involve combining natural and synthetic elements to achieve the desired product, which often changes over time.
  Perfumes, like paintings, are capable of evoking memories and emotions.
  The passage does not express a preference for one type of art over another.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarities between painting and perfume-making.
  The author notes the complex configurations of olfactory elements that produce many small sensations and create an imaginary world, similar to how a painter uses layers of pigments to slowly build up to the surface.
  The author also notes how fine perfume is undervalued due to the substitution of cheap chemical compounds by large corporations in an effort to increase profits.
  The passage, however, does not make a definitive statement about the superiority of one form of art over the other, nor does it indicate that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage compares the similarities of painting and perfumery.
  The author stresses how the element of different smells of perfumes can evoke different sensations.
  The author provides examples of how talented perfumers can effectively use various chemical compounds complexities to develop perfume's complexity to have different smells just as painters use multiple types of paint to build a painting's color spectrum.
  In describing the technique used to make the painting and perfume, the author mentions how both the appearance of a painting and its smell gradually change over time.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art- B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery.
  In perfumery, talented perfumers can create an imaginary world no less powerful or intimate than that of a great composer or painter.
  In calling on our capacity to discover memories in scents, perfumers are in the same business as an artist that creates the illusion of life on canvas.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage compares the art of oil painting and fragrance-making and mentions the similarities between them.
  The author argues that perfumes are not given as much attention as other forms of art.
  The author criticizes large corporations for devaluing perfumes by tampering with the ingredients to cut costs.
  The author suggests that the ability of a great perfume to evoke an emotional response is similar to that of a painting or music.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for statement A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarities between perfumery and other fine arts such as painting and music.
  It suggests that perfumers create an imaginary world like painters and musicians.
  The author believes that truly great smells are undervalued in the current market because large corporations tamper with their formulas to increase their profit.
  The passage does not suggest that one form of art is superior to others or that a work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for commercial success.
  The passage does provide support for statement A because it suggests that perfumes can bring about an aesthetic experience by evoking memories.
  The passage also supports statement B because it suggests that perfumers experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements to produce many small sensations in symphonic combination.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions can reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction without genetic material.
  The discovery of prions challenges the assumption that all pathogens contain genetic material.
  The last paragraph mentions the possibility of a similar process of protein malformation being involved in other degenerative neurological conditions.
  The passage's main point revolves around the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that causes cellular destruction and reproduces without genetic material, hence undermining the assumption that all pathogens contain genetic material.
  The best answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage is about the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen causing a deadly degenerative brain disease called CJD. The pathogen lacks genetic material and reproduces itself by initiating a chain reaction that transforms other normal proteins, creating a plaque that destroys nerve cells in the brain.

A: The passage mentions the mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves. However, this is not the main point of the passage.
B: This choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage regarding the discovery of prions as a new class of pathogen unique in their ability to reproduce themselves without genetic material and causing CJD.
C: This choice goes beyond the information presented in the passage and is not the main point of the passage.
D: The passage mentions skepticism about prions being the cause of CJD in the past. However, this idea has been challenged and now widely supported, so it is not the main point.
E: This choice accurately expresses the main point of the passage regarding prions' capacity to reproduce themselves despite lacking genetic material.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The main point of the passage is the discovery of a new class of infectious pathogens called prions.
  Prions are capable of reproducing and causing cellular destruction without genetic material.
  Prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Since prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  Prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens and a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The article discusses the discovery of prions, a protein pathology, which is different from other pathogens on the basis of their ability to reproduce without any genetic material.
  The article provides information about the properties of prions, how prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction, and their link with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
  The article mentions the skepticism that the discovery of the link between prions and CJD initially faced in the scientific community.
  Option A is incorrect because although the article mentions that the exact mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves is not yet completely understood, it is not the main point.
  Option B correctly expresses the main point of the passage - the discovery of prions, a unique class of protein pathogens, responsible for CJD, that reproduce themselves without genetic material.
  Option C is incorrect because the article mentions that possibility that prions might be responsible for 'other' degenerative neurological conditions. There is no mention of 'most' neurological conditions.
  Option D is incorrect because although the article mentions skepticism faced by the discovery initially, it is not the main point of the passage.
  Option E is partially correct, but it is not the main point of the passage. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how prions are a new type of protein pathogen that can cause degenerative neurological diseases such as CJD.
  Prions are unique in that they lack nucleic acid and they reproduce themselves by converting other normally-shaped prions into the dangerous abnormal shape.
  The discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially met with skepticism, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions and their involvement in causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions lack nucleic acid and consist mainly of protein and, unlike other pathogens, they occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  Prions are capable of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal pathogenic conformation, which produces plaques in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  This cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  The main point of the passage is that research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens, known as prions, that are uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material in an unexpected way.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage is about the discovery of prions as a new type of pathogen.
  The discovery of prions as a pathogen is because they can reproduce without genetic material.
  CJD is an example of a deadly disease caused by prions.
  The passage discusses the detection and mechanism of prions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage describes the identification and characteristics of the pathogen that causes CJD, a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
Researchers have coined the term "prion" for this type of protein pathogen, which is characterized by its lack of nucleic acid.
Prions exhibit an abnormal conformation that induces normal prions to transform themselves, reproducing through a cascade of transformations that produce plaques of thread-like structures that collect in the brain and destroy nerve cells.
Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, where they normally exist as harmless proteins in many of the body's tissues. However, under certain conditions, they can convert their structure into a dangerous abnormal shape and become pathogenic.
The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains what an infection is and what causes an infection.
  It then explains how scientists discovered a new type of protein pathogen called prions that is responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and how prions reproduce themselves.
  The last paragraph mentions that prions may be related to other degenerative neurological conditions.
  The main point of the passage is that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  Choice B accurately expresses the main point of the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argued that neuroscience suggests that retribution should not be considered as a justification of punishment by criminal-justice systems because people may not be making free and rational choices.
  Passage B argued that free will can coexist with determinism and focuses on distinguishing between free actions and constrained actions.
  Passage A did not make any explicit reference to the concept of free choice, while passage B presented a theory of soft determinism, putting forth a distinction between free actions and constrained actions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience suggests the need for the criminal justice system to change its focus from punishment of freely chosen immoral acts to deterrence of future harms.
  Passage B talks about the possibility of free actions in a deterministic world.
  Passage B talks about the distinction between free actions and constrained actions.
  Constrained actions are caused by external sources whereas free actions are caused by internal sources, by one's own will.
  Passage B also points out that actions can be free as long as they are not constrained, and the source of the cause determines whether an action is free.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B, stating that actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained and therefore free even though they may be determined.
  The arguments of Passage A do not mention mental disorder.
  Therefore, the answer is A: mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that behavior is controlled only by the brain, and that rationality does not necessarily mean free choice.
  Passage A argues that the purpose of the criminal justice system should shift away from retribution and toward deterrence.
  Passage B presents Ayer's concept of soft determinism as a way to reconcile determinism with free will.
  Ayer distinguishes between constrained (external source) actions and free (internal source) actions.
  The role of mental disorder is mentioned only in Passage B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that one's behavior is entirely determined by the brain's operations, and that even people who believe they are making rational decisions are often deluded.
  Passage A suggests that consequential thinking should replace retribution in the criminal justice system.
  Passage B argues that free choices are still possible even in a deterministic world.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  Passage B discusses mental disorders as a cause of constrained actions.
  The concept that plays a role in passage B but not in A is mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that all human behavior is caused by the brain.
  According to Passage A, people's idea of free and rational choice may be a self-delusion.
  Based on this, the author of Passage A suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will with respect to determinism.
  The author of Passage B argues that a person can still act freely even though the world is deterministic.
  The author of Passage B focuses on the distinction between free and constrained actions.
  Given these differences between the two passages, the answer to the question should be one of the concepts that Passage B talks about but Passage A does not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A presents an argument that suggests that contrary to the traditional view of law and justice, there is no free and rational moral choice because the brain is responsible for our behavior.
  The passage further suggests that legal punishment should focus on deterring future harms rather than on retribution for immoral acts that are freely chosen.
  Passage B, on the other hand, presents Ayer's theory of soft determinism, in which actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Ayer argues that whenever someone performs a free action to do A, they could have done B instead because no external source precluded doing so. In contrast, constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, and could only have been A.
  Therefore, free choice is an essential concept in Ayer's theory of soft determinism, which plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
  The answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument of Passage A is about how modern neuroscience and the operations of the brain change the way we think about the law and suggests that the law should abandon the idea of retribution instead focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B is about how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and introduces soft determinism as a way of doing that.
  Passage A doesn't mention the concept of 'soft determinism', so it plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in Passage A.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about how neuroscience suggests that humans do not have free will, and therefore the law system should abandon retribution as a justification of punishment.
  Passage B, however, presents the concept of "soft determinism," which argues that people can still act freely in a deterministic world as long as their actions are not constrained.
  The options that play a role in Passage A are neuroscience, law, free and rational moral choice, and the idea of retribution.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in Passage B, as a type of constrained actions, but not in Passage A.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that all human behavior is caused by the operations of the brain.
  This insight suggests that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage A mentions the brain's role in making moral choices.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Ayer puts forth a theory of "soft determinism" which argues that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely.
  Ayer associates the concept of constrained actions with mental disorders.
  Therefore, mental disorders are the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that, since neuroscience shows that our brains cause our actions, the law should focus on deterring future harms, instead of retribution.
  Passage B discusses whether free will and determinism can coexist, and proposes the concept that actions can be "free" or "constrained."
  Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B, but it is not the central concept of this passage. Mental disorders are mentioned in passage A, but they are not discussed as a concept that plays a role in the argument. 
  Free choice is discussed in both passages, but in different ways. Passage A argues that our choices may not be free because our brains are controlling our behavior, and individuals may be delusional about their moral choices. Passage B distinguishes between free and constrained actions and argues that actions can be free as long as they are not constrained.
  Causality is mentioned in both passages but is not the central concept of either. 
  Self-delusion is mentioned in passage A, but not passage B. 
  Moral responsibility is not discussed in passage B, but it is mentioned in passage A as a justification for punishment.

Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?
Choices:
  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split

  The passage mentions how some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  It also mentions that the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  The common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.
  Even though scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  The moment of recognition came in 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided a theoretical connection, recognizing the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the process through which nuclear fission was discovered.
  According to the passage, scientists had evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before Lise Meitner made the crucial theoretical connection.
  The discovery of nuclear fission came as a surprise to many physicists since it went against their previous beliefs.
  Therefore, it is likely that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  It is not mentioned in the passage that calculations indicating atoms could be split were reevaluated.
  The passage mentions that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were compiled as scientists tried to identify them.
  Uranium atoms were not the easiest to split; the researchers were not even focused on achieving nuclear fission.

  The passage describes the history of the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Scientists had compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Scientists did not expect that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.
  Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced, which remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of substances and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  In 1938, Hahn wrote to Meitner of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  Meitner coined the term "nuclear fission," and it took a while for scientists to corroborate the findings, mainly lacking the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, the answer is NOT A because the passage does not mention people neglecting the theoretical developments.
  The answer is also NOT C, because the passage says that the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium were produced, but remained unidentified due to challenges in chemical analyses and expectations of their composition.

  Some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Barium was conclusively identified as one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  
From the above thoughts, it can be inferred that during the 1930s physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments and reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split. Moreover, they identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium and recognized the phenomenon of splitting uranium atoms.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how the discovery of nuclear fission was not immediately recognized by the physics community.
  The passage describes how theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split before the neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The passage also describes how researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved between 1934 and 1939, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Therefore, the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments indicating that atoms could be split.
  The answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how nuclear fission was discovered and developed.
  During this development, the physicists compiled evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing it.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection and realized that the researchers were actually splitting atoms.
  There is no mention in the passage that the community reevaluated earlier theoretical developments, never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split or recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: The passage describes the physics community during the 1930s and how it reacts to the increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Therefore:
  A: The passage does not indicate that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments.
  B: The passage does not describe any reevaluation of calculations, but it does state that some theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  C: The passage contradicts this choice by mentioning a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, although they remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. 
  D: The passage describes the surprising discovery by Hahn and Meitner that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium which is not related to the ease of splitting uranium atoms.
  E: The passage describes the difficulties of the analysis of the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium but it does not underscore the dangers of working with radioactive substances. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author mentions the relevant evidence in line 62.
  According to the passage, "the relevant evidence" is what scientists were witnessing in their experiments between 1934 and 1939.
  The author explains that it took scientists a while to link the relevant evidence to nuclear fission.
  Therefore, "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that scientists compiled increasing to suggest that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Choice A accurately restates the evidence that was compiled over time.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author explains that the relevant evidence had been present for some time.
  The evidence was lacking the right conceptual link.
  In the end, when scientists corroborate the findings, they realized that the relevant evidence was present.
  From the given choices, option A talks about experiments conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. The author states that there was increasing evidence available but scientists couldn't connect the pieces until 1939. Therefore, option A doesn't seem correct.
  Option B talks about experiments conducted by Meitner in 1938. Although she discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances, the author doesn't mention that it was relevant evidence that helped to discover nuclear fission. Therefore, option B also doesn't seem correct.
  Option C talks about Hahn's discovery related to barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Although it was clear chemical evidence, the author doesn't mention if it's relevant evidence that helped to discover nuclear fission.  Therefore, option C also doesn't seem correct.
  Option D says that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. Although this statement connects the link between radioactive products and uranium nucleus, it still doesn't clarify if it was relevant evidence used to discover nuclear fission. Therefore, option D doesn't seem correct.
  Option E talks about the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long. Although this statement is true, it doesn't seem relevant to the discovery of nuclear fission. Therefore, option E doesn't seem correct.
Thus, among all the given options, the only option which seems to be most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. Although it was lacking the right conceptual link, it was relevant evidence used to discover nuclear fission. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence is what connected the "conceptual link" and allowed the researchers to conclude that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  According to the text, it was also said that the "relevant evidence had been present for some time". 
  In late 1938, Hahn identified that one of the substances produced by the neutron bombardment of uranium was indeed identified as barium, which made it impossible to produce from any mechanism he envisaged being involved in the experiments.
  It was also mentioned that this evidence was clear but went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics." 
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" that the author referred to in line 72 is the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author describes the process of discovering nuclear fission and notes that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, "lacking mainly the right conceptual link."
  The relevant evidence refers to the evidence necessary to understand that uranium atoms were being split through neutron bombardment.
  The author explains that Lise Meitner made the conceptual link necessary to recognize the evidence.
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" is "the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939," which comprised the evidence necessary to recognize nuclear fission had occurred through neutron bombardment.
  The answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author is discussing the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The researchers discovered nuclear fission by splitting uranium atoms.
  Barium was found to be one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
  The author refers to the "relevant evidence" (line 62).
  Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to the author means by "the relevant evidence" is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in the context of corroborating the findings of the discovery of nuclear fission. 
  The discovery was initially made by a group of Italian physicists in 1934 when uranium was bombarded with neutrons.
  In 1938, Lise Meitner, who was pursing related research, discovered radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Later that year, Otto Hahn, her research partner, wrote to her of a surprising result - one of the substances could not be produced through any mechanism. He noted that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium (the byproducts of the experiment) added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  When scientists in Europe and North America corroborated the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author describes in the passage how scientists had compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection linking up the relevant evidence of scientists that she recognized as the splitting of uranium atoms.
  Therefore, "the relevant evidence" refers to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 that had been present for some time but were lacking the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence is what was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions that Meitner identified the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  The data, when corroborated by scientists in Europe and North America, revealed that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The author also notes that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence is the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which indicated that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognizing what they were witnessing.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The "relevant evidence" (line 62) is what was present but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The correct answer must describe the evidence that had been present for some time but was unrecognized without the crucial theoretical connection.
  Meinter's recognition that uranium atoms were being split was the theoretical connection and the crucial factor in the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence refers to the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The "relevant evidence" should refer to what scientists were missing to recognize the nuclear fission.
  The passage says that after Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists rushed to corroborate the findings, which had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  The conceptual link refers to the connection between the splitting of atoms and the neutron-bombardment experiments with uranium that scientists had carried out.
  Hence, the relevant evidence should refer to the results of the experiments with uranium that scientists had undertaken before Meitner's contribution and that were not enough to recognize the nuclear fission.
  Therefore, the answer should be A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.

  Choice E does not challenge the characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Thus, Choice B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as:
    - parodying the art world while conveying a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody
    - displaying an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication
    - demonstrating a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling
  To challenge this characterization, we need an answer that presents evidence that contradicts these characteristics.
  Answer A and B are not necessarily contradicted by the given paragraph, but instead provide additional information.
  Answer C is not relevant because it describes Lichtenstein's potential praise of early abstract expressionists, which is not necessarily contradictory to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer D can be eliminated as it talks about the emotional aspect of paintings, which is not mentioned in the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer E contradicts the characterization of Lichtenstein as it notes that he criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion. This does not align with the deliberate naivete aspect that the author notes in Lichtenstein's work.

Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation
  D: outline the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution as it was encoded using wampum
  E: give evidence of wampum's effectiveness as a means of ensuring compliance with the law of the Haudenosaune Confederacy

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading law shouldn't prohibit trading based on information that is gained from analysis of a stock, but should prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. The author believes that such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and that's good for everyone in the stock market.
  Choice A doesn't permit trading based on accurate information is not shared by everyone.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock and prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This is in line with the author of Passage A.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market which is not in line with the author of Passage A.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is in contrast to the position put forth in Passage A stating that insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, as it is consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes insider-trading law as prohibiting using inside information that is not shared by everyone to make stock transactions.
  Passage A argues that using information that not everyone else has is a basic component of a functioning stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading undermines the basic principle of a transparent market and undermines investor confidence, which could destroy the market.
  The position articulated by the author of Passage A but not Passage B is more permissive of nonpublic information being used in the stock market but is against insider trading that would harm the market's fundamental transparency.
  Option A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is not what the author of passage A is in favor of.
  Option C prohibits trading that undermines investor confidence, which is in line with the position described in both passages.
  However, Option B closely aligns with the author of Passage A; the author agrees with permitting informed decision making but is against trading based on inside information gained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that making stock transactions based on insider information is not necessarily a bad thing, as it helps ensure that stock prices reflect accurate information about a company's value.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that insider-trading compromises the market and causes a loss of investor confidence.
  The question asks for a law that would conform most closely to the position taken in Passage A but not that taken in Passage B.
  The most suitable law would be one that legalizes trading based on information obtained from stock analysis, as this is not considered insider trading, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, as this is the main type of insider trading that is problematic.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law isn't necessarily good for the stock market; rather, the market works best when all relevant information is spread widely and quickly, and people who have accurate information should be permitted to act on it so that stock prices reflect the information. Selling a stock because someone knows something will happen that will lower the stock's value, for example, helps to spread knowledge that the price should be dropping.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is not fair because people with access to inside information can make informed trade decisions before others, unfairly compromising the market, and could lead to a loss of investor confidence and ultimately destroy the market.
  A law that would conform to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that of the author of passage B, would be one that legalizes trading based on information that is available to everybody.
  Thus, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This is because it is arguing that trading based on general, publicly available information is not a problem, whereas trading based on inside information is what should remain illegal. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that a functioning stock market is dependent on knowledge not widely available.
  However, it supports insider-trading in certain situations where the information is widely available.
  Passage B argues that an insider trading undermines investor confidence in the market.
  But it should be illegal to use nonpublic, material information to unfairly gain or prevent others from gaining from securities transactions.
  So, a law that brings balance that authorizes trades based on information available to public and prohibits the use of non-public information.
  Hence, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider trading can be beneficial for the stock market as it helps to spread knowledge that the price of a stock ought to be dropping. It is not insider trading itself that is the problem but insider trading that is not disclosed. 
  The author of Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the transparency of the stock market and undermines investor confidence.
  Choice A would restrict trading based on information that is not shared by everyone; however, the author of passage A argues that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts when those who have accurate information are permitted to act.
  Choice B would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but restrict trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is similar to the laws against insider trading in the US.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investor confidence, which would be in line with the position articulated by the author of Passage B.
  Choice D is not applicable because it only legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means, which is not in line with the position articulated by neither the author of Passage A nor the author of Passage B.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant, accurate information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  They stated that trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have is not criminal.
  The author argues that selling a stock because you know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps ensure that the stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts and that this is good for everyone in the stock market.
  The author of passage B, on the other hand, argues that insider-trading situations unfairly compromise the market and undermines investor confidence.
  The author of passage A is likely to support a law that permits trading that is based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Choice A goes against the author's argument in passage A that trading based on information everyone else doesn't have is not criminal.
  Choice C is more aligned with passage B's argument that insider-trading situations undermine investor confidence.
  Choices D and E involve situations of trading based on inside information, which is not what the author stresses in passage A.
  Therefore, choice B is the best option as it prohibits only trading on insider information and allows intelligent analysis of stock for trading. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should not prohibit trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Instead, it contends that insider-trading law should only prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading situations undermine the transparency of the stock market and deny people who don't have inside information a fair chance to make informed trade decisions.
  The author of passage A believes that those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  Therefore, the author of passage A would most likely support a law that allow individuals to trade based on information gained from analysis of a stock.
  However, the law would prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  So, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The author of Passage A believes that it is okay to trade based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  However, the author admits that it is illegal to trade based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company.
  The author of Passage A emphasizes that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  A law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company will conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else does not have, if it is obtained legally through analysis of the stock.
  The author of passage B argues that insider trading should be prohibited because it could lead to unfair trading advantage for some and undermine investor confidence in the market. 
  Therefore, the answer would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, as this conforms to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories for how neurons communicate with each other.
  One theory is that electrical signals leap across synapses.
  The other theory is that neurotransmitters carry chemical signals between neurons.
  The second theory has gained more acceptance because of research findings about the structure of receptors.
  Receptors contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Studies have shown that different types of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels make up a family of receptors.
  These receptors come in several varieties so that each receptor may have slightly different properties.
  The differences among receptors could be exploited to selectively treat certain brain disorders using drugs that will target specific receptors.
  The passage's main point is that the workings of the brain are guided by neurotransmitters rather than electrical signals, and that the differences among receptors have important medical implications.
  The best answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two theories of how communication between neurons in the brain is achieved.
  The first theory argues that electrical impulses are responsible for the communication.
  The second theory argues that neurotransmitters are responsible for the communication.
  The passage presents evidence that supports the second theory and describes how these neurotransmitters work.
  The passage also suggests that the fact that receptors for neurotransmitters differ from one another may allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that evidence shows how the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and the subtle differences among these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two different theories regarding the transmission of signals between neurons in the brain.
  The first theory is that electrical impulses travel across synapses between neurons.
  The second theory is that chemical neurotransmitters bind with receptors on the receiving neuron and render the receptor permeable to ions, generating an electrical impulse in the cell that is propagated to the receiving neuron.
  The passage goes on to explain that the second theory is becoming increasingly accepted due to evidence that neurotransmitter receptors contain both a binding site and a channel for ions. It notes that different receptors for different neurotransmitters have slightly different properties and come in different varieties.
  The passage concludes by pointing out that understanding these differences may lead to the selective treatment of brain disorders through drugs targeted to specific receptors on specific neurons. 
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the chemical theory of neural transmission between neurons has become increasingly accepted due to evidence that neurotransmitter receptors contain a binding site and ions channel and that this may pave the way for targeted drug treatments of specific brain disorders based on differences among neurotransmitter receptors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is usually found in the topic sentence of the first paragraph or in the concluding paragraph.
  The topic of the passage is about the workings of the brain and the transmission of electrochemical signals.
  The passage explains that electrical impulses are transmitted chemically, through the use of neurotransmitters that bind to specific receptors on the surface of neurons. 
  These receptors contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, and attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component.
  These receptors have enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, and this discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the most complete and accurate statement is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two theories about the means by which neurons in the brain communicate.
  One theory is that communication is exclusively through electrical signals.
  The second theory is that the communication between neurons is possible chemically through neurotransmitters.
  This alternative theory hypothesizes that neurotransmitters bind with receptor molecules in the receiving neuron to create an electrical impulse that is transmitted to the neurons through the cell.
  The passage also highlights that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both the binding site of the neurotransmitter and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, which opens when the neurotransmitter is attached to the binding site.
  This discovery is significant because it may enable the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Thus, the main point of the passage is that evidence suggests that the workings of the brain are guided not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage is discussing the history of theories about the way the brain communicates
  The old theory was that electrical impulses traveled across synapses
  In the alternative theory, neurons secrete neurotransmitters which bind to receptors on other neurons, leading to electrical activity
  Eventually, evidence was found for a mechanism by which receptors convert chemical signals into electrical activity
  Discoveries about differences among receptors and their effect on behavior may lead to highly selective treatments for certain brain disorders
  The main point of the passage is that recent evidence has supported an alternative theory to the electrical impulses theory for brain communication, and that this new understanding may lead to selective treatments for certain brain disorders based on the differentiation among receptors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories for the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons. 
  The first theory suggests that communication between neurons was guided only by electrical signals. 
  The second theory suggests that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically. 
  Evidence supports the second theory and shows that neurotransmitters bind to receptors that contain an ion channel; this binding to the receptor causes the channel to open, which allows the neurotransmitter to transmit electrical signals. 
  Receptors for several neurotransmitters have similarities, and this discovery could be used to selectively target brain disorders for treatment. 
  Choice A correctly summarizes this main point.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains different theories on how communication between neurons might be achieved.
  It describes how electrical impulses were initially thought to be responsible for this communication, but later disproven.
  Instead, a chemical theory was proposed in which neurotransmitters carry information from one neuron to another via a receptor that opens to allow ions to flow through the membrane of the receiving neuron.
  It goes on to explain that evidence shows that these receptors have a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate channel for ions which leads to the selective treatment of brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals rather than electrical signals, and subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two theories that neurobiologists believed about the means by which neurons communicate.
  The prevailing theory was that electrical impulses traveled from neuron to neuron by leaping across synapses.
  However, some scientists speculated that chemical transmitters were used instead of electrical signals to transmit information.
  This latter theory gained acceptance over time, and it was discovered that particular receptors on neurons mediated the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity that allow neurons to send information to one another.
  Additionally, variations among receptors for different transmitters raise the possibility of selective treatments for brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that neurotransmitters are used instead of electrical impulses as a means of transmitting information between neurons, and there are subtle variations between receptors in the brain that make it a promising target for the development of treatments for certain brain disorders.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals, which neurobiologists have recently discovered.
  The passage explains how the neurotransmitter binding to the receptor causes the receptor to change shape and allow the ions to flow through and trigger electrical activity in the receiving neuron.
  The passage then discusses the discovery of a family of receptors and how the discovery of the subtle differences among them can allow selective treatments for certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals and that selective treatments for certain brain disorders are possible due to the discovery of receptor molecules.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes the discovery of prions in relation to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are protein pathogens that reproduce themselves by inducing normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions exist naturally in many of the body's tissues and are capable of reproducing themselves only because of their ability to convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. 
  Therefore, without the transformation of the structures of prions, CJD would not occur.
  The passage does not support any of the remaining choices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage explains that prions cause CJD.
Prions are a new type of infectious pathogen lacking nucleic acid and consist mainly of proteins.
Prions can reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction.
The buildup of plaques resulting from infected prions destroys nerve cells and results in CJD.
CJD is inevitably fatal.
The passage does not mention option A as the only way CJD can be transmitted is not specified.
B is not the most strongly supported choice as the passage does not indicate that most infectious diseases thought previously to be caused by other pathogens are instead caused by prions.
C is supported by the passage as the passage indicates that prions must be able to reproduce themselves to cause CJD.
D is not supported by the passage as the passage indicates that protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions but does not mention that CJD is caused by the same prion pathogens that cause Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.
Option E is not supported by the passage as the passage refers to "wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses", which indicates that the speed at which prion diseases progress could vary and is not necessarily more aggressive than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses a new type of pathogen called prion that lacks nucleic acid and consists mainly of protein and is responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions transform from normally shaped proteins into an abnormal shape that can reproduce itself.
  Cascading transformations create a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  Prions are a new class of infectious pathogens and are believed to be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease but the exact mechanisms are not completely understood.
  
  Based on the above reasoning, the only statement that is most strongly supported by this passage is that 'If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.'
Action: Answer("C")

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  Diminishing returns are necessary for the Invisible Hand to work properly.
  But increasing returns, as characterized by the Pin Factory, are hard to represent mathematically.
  Only recently has the idea of increasing returns been incorporated into economic thought.
Action: Answer("B")  
The main point of the passage is that the functioning of the Invisible Hand in economics is accepted primarily because diminishing returns, which are necessary for it to work properly, can be described with mathematical rigor.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about two economic concepts: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory describes increasing returns to scale, which makes firms big and tend toward monopolization.
  The Invisible Hand describes how a market economy harnesses self-interest to the common good.
  There is a contradiction between the two concepts because the Pin Factory leads to monopolization, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors.
  The early economics theory assumed diminishing returns to scale. The Pin Factory was "de-emphasized" because it was hard to represent mathematically.
  Recently, there have been attempts to bring the Pin Factory to mainstream economic thought.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that increasing returns to scale has been under-emphasized in economics, but recent developments have brought this concept to the forefront.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the need for increasing returns to produce more.
  The Invisible Hand works when many competitors are present in the market.
  Returns to scale are important to determine whether monopolies exist or not.
  Recent developments have enabled the Pin Factory to surface in economic thought.
  The main point of the passage is that economics has historically struggled to incorporate the idea of increasing returns but recent developments have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled and integrated into economic thought, given the necessity of understanding the importance of scale to determine the presence of competition in markets.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The article discusses two economic concepts: The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory is related to the idea of economies of scale and is characterized by increasing returns to scale.
  The Invisible Hand is related to the idea that a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good and depends on many competitors, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Increasing returns, characteristic of the Pin Factory, give natural tendency to monopoly.
  The assumptions of diminishing returns had dominated economic theory until the late 1970s. 
  Only recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled rigorously.
  Diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor but the increasing returns of the Pin Factory are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.
  Therefore, economists had failed for a long time to account for the increasing returns to scale.
  The passage's main point is about how the idea of increasing returns to scale in economics has only emerged into mainstream thought until recently.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage presents two concepts - Pin Factory and Invisible hand.
It explains the contradiction between these concepts and how it presents a challenge to economic theory.
It establishes the necessity of many competitors in the market for the Invisible Hand to work properly.
It explains how the Pin Factory concept has been hard to represent mathematically.
It also explains how recent developments in mathematics have helped to bring the Pin Factory to the mainstream of economic thought.
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes a contradiction between two concepts in economics: the pin factory and the invisible hand.
  The invisible hand refers to how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading to the promotion of an end that was no part of the individual's intention.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increased efficiency through specialization and increasing returns to scale, which leads to the opposite effect of the invisible hand: large firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, creating monopolies.
  The assumption that diminishing returns dominate economic thought is what has predominated in mainstream economics, while the Pin Factory has been disregarded as it is hard to represent mathematically.
  However, throughout the text, it is clear that the Pin Factory has been reintegrated into mainstream economics, and it continues to provide insight into economies.
  Therefore, E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries, best describes the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale while the Invisible Hand emphasizes the common good that comes from self-interest.
  The Pin Factory's idea is very hard to represent mathematically and economists tried repeatedly but failed to bring it to mainstream economic thoughts.
  Only recently, have economists found ways to mathematically describe the Pin Factory with the necessary rigor for it to be respectable in economic thoughts.
  Thus, the main point of the passage is that increases to scale, as described by the Pin Factory, have struggled to become mainstream in economic thought because it is mathematically hard to convert into rigorous formalism.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses an inherent contradiction in economic theory and how this contradiction affected the use of increasing returns. The Pin Factory, a concept that represents increasing returns, is harder to represent than diminishing returns. Economics has always had scientific aspirations and economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations.  Only since the late 1970s has the role of increasing returns come into the mainstream of economic thought.
  Choice A is incorrect because it only refers to one part of the passage. It is also imprecise and does not fully capture the main point.
  Choice B is a close contender, but it is not the best answer. While it refers to the role of diminishing returns and the Invisible Hand, it does not capture the contradiction between increasing returns and the Invisible Hand discussed in the passage.
  Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not compare the levels of rigor between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand models.
  Choice D is incorrect because it only covers one part of the passage.
  The best answer is E because it accurately summarizes the passage's main point. It states that until somewhat recently, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two concepts in economic thought:
  1) The Pin Factory, which relates to the idea that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopolies
  2) The Invisible Hand, which argues that self-interest can lead to positive outcomes for society as a whole
  The passage shows how these two ideas contradict each other and how economists struggled to reconcile them mathematically.
  The final paragraph mentions that economists have only recently been able to incorporate the idea of increasing returns to scale into mainstream economic thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
  It explains how these two concepts conflict with each other. 
  The passage highlights the assumption of diminishing returns that dominated economic theory, because it can be represented with elegant formalism. 
  It discusses how increasing returns- the Pin Factory- have been hard to represent mathematically but have recently surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. 
  The main point of the passage therefore seems to be about the contradiction inherent in economic theory, the conflict between the Pin Factory and Invisible Hand, and how recent developments have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades
Response 0:
Thought: 
The passage describes the Great Migration, a significant movement in the early twentieth century of African Americans from the South to the North and provides theories for its occurrence and continuance.
The passage discusses how the Great Migration began and why it continued, focusing on the factors that made migration less difficult and costly for potential migrants. It also describes how earlier migrants aided later migrants in reducing the financial costs of migration and adapting to new locales and cultures. The main point of the passage is that earlier migrants facilitate later migration and provide a cushion that makes subsequent migration less difficult and costly. 
Therefore, the answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Response 1:
Thought: The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the North between 1915 and 1960. It describes the catalysts for the migration and the reasons why it continued and accelerated over time. The passage also explains how earlier migrants reduce the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants. The main point is that the Great Migration was triggered by specific factors, but it continued and accelerated due to a combination of economic and social factors that made migration easier. In particular, earlier migrants played an important role in reducing the costs and difficulties of migration for later migrants. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern United States to the Northern industrial cities between 1915 and 1960.
  The main point of the passage is not just about the occurrence of the Great Migration, but rather about why migration continued and even accelerated in subsequent decades.
  The passage explains that migration developed momentum over time as current migration reduced the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  The passage provides evidence of how previous migrants reduced the physical costs of moving, provided a cultural cushion, and helped defray the financial costs of migration, which encouraged later migrations to the North.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants played a significant role in accelerating the Great Migration by reducing the difficulties and costs of migration for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage describes the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North between 1915 and 1960. The passage explains that three factors contributed to the Great Migration, but it continues to discuss why migration continued after these factors stopped being relevant. The passage argues that the Great Migration persisted because previous migrants made it easier and less costly for future migrants to move. These previous migrants provided information about housing and labor-market conditions, they reduced physical costs for early migrants, and they also provided a cultural cushion for new migrants, so they did not have to struggle as much with new surroundings. Therefore, the main point of the passage is that in migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North.
  It explains why the migration started and accelerated, and discusses factors that contributed to its duration.
  Specifically, it describes how earlier migrants reduced the physical and financial costs of migration as well as provided support in cultural and linguistic adaptation.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants helped to reduce the barriers and support later migrants in the Great Migration.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the Great Migration of African Americans from the South to the North.
  It notes that there were at least three catalysts for the migration, including World War I, immigration restrictions, and a boll weevil infestation.
  The passage also highlights the role of previous migrants in reducing the costs and difficulties of future migration.
  The main idea of the passage is that the Great Migration was a complex phenomenon triggered by multiple factors and sustained by the momentum of previous migrants helping future migrants.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The first paragraph describes the catalysts for the Great Migration.
  The second paragraph describes the reasons why the Great Migration continued and even accelerated, despite North-South income differences narrowing.
  It points to the idea that migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration.
  Later, the paragraph elaborates on how previous migrants help new migrants in terms of reducing the costs of moving and adapting to a new locale and culture.
  The main point of the passage seems to suggest that the Great Migration was not a one-off event that had a single cause, but rather a complex process that was influenced by various factors. This process of migration was self-reinforcing, and snowballed over time as migrants passed information on to one another and made the process easier for the next wave of migrants.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the causes and factors that contributed to the Great Migration of African Americans from the Southern U.S. to the Northern industrial cities between 1915 and 1960.
  The author argues that the main reason for the start of the Great Migration was an income gap between the North and South due to World War I labor demand and boll weevil infestation that reduced labor demand in the South.
  The author also discusses how the migration momentum continued and accelerated over time due to previous migrants reducing the cost and difficulty of future migration.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that earlier migrants reduce the physical and cost barriers to migration and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants, which is why the Great Migration continued to grow and accelerate over several decades.
  The answer is D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that a functioning stock market depends on transparency and the dissemination of information that influences trading decisions to all market participants in order to ensure accurate stock prices.
  Passage B agrees and argues that insider trading compromises the transparency of the stock market by giving those with access to inside information an unfair advantage and could lead to widespread financial repercussions.
  Thus, the authors of both passages would likely agree that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and B have different perspectives on insider trading.
  Passage A believes that there are "good" insider trading and "bad" insider trading where the former provides accurate assessments of all the relevant facts so that stock prices reflect a more accurate picture. 
  On the other hand, Passage B asserts that insider trading compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
  Hence, answer A seems to be the best answer as both passages suggest that insider trading can harm investor confidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading law is problematic since the stock market depends on everyone trading based on unique information. Additionally, it argues that the functioning of the market relies on the accuracy of the spread of information. 
  Passage B argues that a basic principle of the stock market is transparency, which ensures everyone has the same chance of making a good investment and success is based on individual merit and skill. Insider trading compromises that fairness and transparency and threatens investor confidence in the market.
  Considering both passages, the authors seem to agree upon the importance of transparency and fair competition in the stock market. They recognize that investors seek to gain an advantage through superior stock analysis, however, they disagree on whether or not insider trading is permissible based on these analyses. Passage A presents the argument that insider trading should not be regulated since it hinders the spread of accurate information. Conversely, Passage B argues that insider trading should be regulated since it threatens the fairness and transparency of the market, thus compromising investor confidence.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that Answer("B"): all information should be available to all market participants at the same time. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that trading based on information not known to everyone is a necessary part of a functioning stock market that promotes accurate stock prices.
  Passage B, in contrast, argues that transparency is crucial for maintaining a level playing field in the stock market and that insider trading undermines investor confidence.
  The authors have different opinions on insider trading.
  Choice A aligns with the argument made in Passage B that insider trading undermines investor confidence.
  Choice B aligns with Passage B's argument on the importance of transparency.
  Choice C seems to align with the argument made in Passage A that it's appropriate for investors to seek an advantage based on superior analysis.
  Choice D seems to suggest that insider nontrading should be regulated the same as insider trading, but there's no indication in either passage to support this statement.
  Choice E is opposite of both passages' opinions on insider trading and contradicts the argument made in Passage B on the importance of transparency.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that Answer("A") insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Response 4:
Thought:
  Both Passage A and Passage B discuss insider-trading and the importance of transparency in the stock market.
  Passage A argues that insider knowledge can help spread knowledge that ought to be reflected in the stock prices. 
  Moreover, insider nontrading should not be treated criminally since it is an important part of stock analysis.
  Passage B discusses how insider-trading creates an unfair advantage in the stock market and undermines investor confidence. 
  It is important for all market participants to have access to the same information at the same time.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that allowing insider trading would help to distribute knowledge and make prices in the market more accurate.
  On the other hand, Passage B contends that insider trading undermines the market's transparency and erodes investor confidence.
  The authors of Passage A seem to support the idea that insider trading, to some extent, should be allowed while the authors of Passage B do not.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A supports that informational advantage such as superior stock analysis should not be limited.
  Passage B argues that the lack of transparency and access to insider information creates a disadvantage for investors who do not possess it and can lead to a loss of confidence and financial repercussions.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A presents an argument that stock markets work best when all relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible and quickly as possible, and that insider trading helps to spread accurate information about changing circumstances.
  Passage B presents an argument that insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, and that transparency is key to investor confidence and success in the stock market.
  The two passages are opposed to each other with respect to insider trading.
  Since the question asks for a statement that the authors of both passages would most likely agree, the correct answer should be a statement that either agrees with both passages or at least doesn't contradict either passage.
  Choice A is supported by Passage B.
  Choice B is supported by Passage B and is not directly opposed to Passage A.
  Choice C is supported by Passage A.
  Choice D is not discussed in either passage, so we can't determine whether both authors would agree with it.
  Choice E is not supported by either passage; rather, both passages draw attention to the importance of disseminating information to all investors as widely as possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading laws may hinder the spread of relevant information in the stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading is harmful to the stock market because it negatively affects investor confidence and undermines transparency.
  The authors in both passages seem to agree on the importance of transparency and equal access to information to the success of the stock market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading is not always bad and that it can help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market and that information should be available to all market participants at the same time.
  The authors of these two passages seem to have different views on insider trading.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors would most likely disagree on the impact of insider trading on investor confidence in the stock market.
  Choice A is the most likely answer.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain
  E: suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph talks about why migration continued despite narrowing income differences between the North and the South.
  The first half of the last sentence talks about how migration developed momentum over time as migrants pass on information about the labor and housing conditions through letters or conversation.
  The second half of the last sentence mentions how the early migrants provided temporary housing, food and credit to new migrants.
  The sentence aims to explain how previous migrants assisted later migrants in adapting to a new locale and culture. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  In the given paragraph, the last sentence of the second paragraph talks about how migrants in the early days shared information, familiarized new migrants with local labor- and housing-market institutions, provided temporary housing, food, and even credit. 
  The purpose of this statement is to explain how the previous migrants provided the later migrants with help for their ease of migration by providing useful information that can help adapt to the new locale and culture.
  Option D accurately represents the purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The last sentence of the second paragraph states "In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration." 
The last sentence in paragraph two helps the author explain why the Great Migration began in 1915. 
The purpose of the last sentence is not to challenge any traditional views nor suggest that the Great Migration cannot be explained.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The last sentence of the second paragraph talks about how migration develops momentum over time and how previous migrants supported later migrants. 
The following sentence begins with "Thus" to provide an example of how early migrants provided information through letters etc. 
The sentence following the last sentence talks about how previous migrants supported new migrants. 
None of the above choices captures the purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph is "In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration."
  The question is asking what is the purpose of this sentence.
  The authors state the cause of the Great Migration starting in 1915.
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph is “Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing.” 
  The primary purpose of the last sentence is to indicate that something is not clear or difficult to explain.
  The subsequent paragraphs referring to how migration developed momentum may provide an explanation for the continuation and acceleration of migration.
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The last sentence of the second paragraph refers to the migration's continued and accelerated pace over time even as North-South income differences were narrowing and the primary causes of the Great Migration were largely resolved.
  The sentence suggests that the Great Migration was due, in part, to social factors such as information-sharing and cultural support among migrants which has contributed to its longevity.
  The purpose of the sentence is to explain how the social and cultural factors gave the movement momentum and accelerated it beyond what would have been predicted.
  Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The second paragraph explains that the reason for the start of the Great Migration was the higher labor demand in the industrial North due to WWI and also due to boll weevil infestation, which mined cotton crops in the South, reducing labor demand in the South. The paragraph ends with a sentence that refers to difficulties and one-time costs of migration. The third paragraph starts by referring to empirical studies related to difficulties that migrants face. At the end of the third paragraph, the authors refer to "previous migrants," suggesting that the information about the labor- and housing-market conditions was passed through letters and communication when migrants came back home from the North. The last sentence of the third paragraph concludes that previous migrants reduced the cost for new migrants by providing them with temporary housing, food, and credit and by serving as a cultural cushion for later migrants. Therefore, the answer is D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain.   
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The last sentence of the second paragraph talks about providing a cultural cushion for later migrants.
  The sentence is not disagreeing with any traditional view or challenging previous research.
  The preceding sentences talk about how previous migrants provided assistance to later migrants in different ways.
  Therefore, the primary purpose of the last sentence is to present a fact about the Great Migration (previous migrants provided a cultural cushion) that the authors seek to explain (why migration continued and even accelerated).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  To answer this question, I need to identify the focus of the sentence and the context of that sentence.
  The focus of the sentence is to mention "previous migrants" and what they did for new migrants.
  The context of the sentence is to explain how the cost and difficulty of migration were reduced for future migrants and to explain the mechanism by which future migration developed momentum.
  Option B correctly summarizes the content of the sentence and the context. Therefore, the answer is B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be compared to other relationships.
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. Secondary substances have no known role in plants’ internal chemical processes; they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Cars require mechanical components such as engines and transmissions to run; features such as paint and taillights are not essential.
  There is no clear relationship between clothing factories and mechanical components or electrical components.
  Braking systems are required for trains to stop. Braking systems have friction and pneumatic components.
  Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to function as word processors but can either be stored in the computer's internal memory or on external disks.
  Option B describes relationships that are the most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances because cars need to run with mechanical components such as engines and transmissions but the car's features such as paint and taillights are not essential for cars to run.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationship between plants and their two categories of chemical substances is analogous to a set of relationships that describes two categories of components, one of which is necessary for the functioning of the whole, while the other category serves additional functions or characterizes the whole in some way.
  Choice B, mechanical components necessary for an automobile to run and additional features that make it distinctive, is the closest to describing a set of relationships analogous to that between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  A relationship meant to compare with the one between plants and their primary and secondary substances must have a pair of substances with different functions.
  Based on these considerations, a relationship most closely analogous to the one between plants and their primary and secondary substances is plants and their parts that are necessary for their growth and proper functioning but do not provide visual or aesthetic characteristics, and parts that are not essential for growth or proper functioning, but that give the plant its features such as its color and shape.
  The only alternative that presents such a relationship is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes the chemical composition of plants.
  Primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning, and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances serve a variety of purposes, such as to attract pollinators, defend against predators, and dissuade insects from feeding.
  Therefore, secondary substances are the less essential of the two categories.
  Answer choice B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationship between primary and secondary substances.
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for cars to run.
  Features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The primary substances of plants are required for their growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  The secondary substances are diverse chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  This relationship implies that the primary substances are essential, but the secondary substances are not necessary for the plant to function.
  To answer the question, we need to find a set of relationships that have a similar characteristic.
  Option B has a similar relationship; mechanical components like engines and transmissions are essential, while features like paint and taillights do not affect the car's primary function.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage explains the relationship between plants' chemical composition and their distinctive smells and tastes.
  Primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are diverse chemicals that have no known role in growth and metabolism but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances are biochemical defenses against insect predators.
  Insects' competition with plants has resulted in fewer and fewer plants remaining as suitable food sources.
  These relationships are most closely analogous to which one of the given set of relationships?
  B seems like a possible answer, as it describes mechanical components as necessary for a car to run and features like paint and taillights as giving a car its distinctive appearance.
  However, the passage specifically states that primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, whereas the features of a car do not have a direct impact on its proper functioning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  This passage discusses plants and their primary (essential for growth) and secondary (give taste and smell) substances.
  The relationship between plants and these two types of substances can be best compared to a relationship where there is something necessary for proper functioning and something else that gives the entity its distinctive features.
  Among the choices, (B) best describes this relationship with its comparison of mechanical components (necessary for functioning) and paint and taillights (produce distinctiveness).
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to function; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances, primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive tastes and smells that plants have.
  Secondary substances arose by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against insects.
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to a set of relationships in which two types of components are required or present but are not equal in their import or contribution to the overall whole.
  Option B describes a set of relationships in which the same applies.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks for a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  It is secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects appear to have played a major role in coating many plants with secondary substances they have today.
  Similarly, the relationships in the answer choices also have one component that is necessary for proper functioning or a specific task and another component that gives it a distinctive look or serves other additional functions.
  So, the answer choice that describes the most closely analogous set of relationships is the one that has a similar pattern.
  Option B talks about mechanical components that are necessary for the functioning of automobiles, and features that give it a distinctive look and serve additional functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but cars can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants, which consist of both primary and secondary substances.
  The primary substances are necessary for growth and proper functioning.
  The secondary substances are diverse and have no known role in internal chemical processes.
  Secondary substances are responsible for distinctive tastes and smells in plants.
  Action: The relationship between primary and secondary substances is best analogous to the relationship between mechanical components that are necessary for operation and additional features that improve function but are not essential. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought:
In the passage, Taruskin's view is described as focusing on the way art "embodied the ideology of the elite" but critics must also determine that the art wasn't being subverted by the artists working on it. The passage doesn't suggest that Taruskin believes in hidden meanings that tie between the ideology of the elite and art. Therefore, A and C are incorrect. The passage doesn't mention anything about the most successful artists working today, so B is incorrect. The passage mentions that talented artists sometimes have to find a place in the margins of the establishment, not that they are always from the middle or aristocratic classes, so D is incorrect. The passage doesn't suggest that subversion is the key to artistic talent, so E is incorrect. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Taruskin's position on how sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with art produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage mentions that for this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their reasons.
  Since the passage does not support any of the choices, we need to eliminate the options.
  We can eliminate options A, B, and E, as none of these options are supported by the passage.
  Option D is also incorrect because the passage doesn't mention the social class of the artists who produced art reflecting the ideology of the elite.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Taruskin's position on art produced by and for political and social elites.
  The passage suggests that Taruskin prefers to deal with art produced by the second way, where art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  However, the passage also notes that a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, but endured and needed subtle analysis to explain how it embodied the ideals of the elite.
  The passage implies that Taruskin's position does not necessarily commit to the view of the most talented artists throughout history or those whose work embodies the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  Therefore, the correct answer is not A or C.
  The passage does not discuss the most successful artists working today; hence B is also incorrect.
  The passage suggests that more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment where they were engaged by rich patrons with eccentric tastes.
  However, the passage does not state that artists who produce art reflecting the ideology of the elite are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes. So D is also incorrect.
  The only plausible option left is E, that Taruskin's view commits him to agreeing that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Taruskin's position is that "high art" is produced by and for political and social elites.
  There are two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  Taruskin and others prefer to analyze the second way.
  The analysis needs to be done carefully to make sure the ideals of the elite are truly embodied in the work.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest any of the choices.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how sociohistorical interpretations of art view it as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals, and how there are two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  Taruskin prefers to deal with art produced in the second way because he believes it embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  The more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of the elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Taruskin and other critics deal with art that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, commissioned by the elite.
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's and other critics' analysis requires the existence of a recognizable identity by the elite and their display of some kind of consensus about life and world.
  The passage suggests that art that is against the grain of elite values sometimes endures and that sociohistorical critics claim that such art embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Taruskin's position on art produced by and for political and social elites.
  According to the passage, the sociohistorical critic prefers to deal with art that is produced to express and mirror one's ideals and way of life.
  The passage indicates that it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity, and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The passage notes that some of the art that went against the grain of elite values endured, and the sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that this art secretly embodied the ideals of the elite. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Taruskin's position in terms of "sociohistorical interpretations of art produced for political and social elites."
  The passage explains that the analysis works if the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The passage explains that some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings, yet it endured.
  The passage suggests that the sociohistorical critic must claim that this art embodied the ideals of the elite, which were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage mentions Taruskin as a sociohistorical critic.
  Sociohistorical critics deal with art produced by and for political and social elites.
  The art produced by elites might reflect their ideals and way of life.
  According to the passage, there are two different ways that art was produced by elites.
  Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced in the second way.
  For this kind of analysis to work, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world.
  The passage mentions that the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment and a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the choice C seems to be the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Taruskin is a sociohistorical critic, dealing with the way in which art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The analysis of this kind of art requires that the elite has a recognizable identity and consensus about the world they want and that artists did not subvert the patron's ideals for their own reasons.
  The passage suggests that Taruskin's position should deal with the second way in which art was produced by and for political and social elites, the one that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  The passage does not mention anything about the talent or success of those artists.
  The passage notes that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly.
  The passage does not prefer one way or another.
  The answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the study of dance?
Choices:
  A: Most social scientists who have attempted to study dance as a cultural phenomenon have misinterpreted it.
  B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.
  D: Most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology.
  E: Dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks about the view of "peers" on the study of dance.
  Peers refers to other social scientists who are likely to decide what areas justified scientific research.
  The passage mentions that previously dance had been neglected as an area of social research because social scientists did not grasp it well or they believed that effective data gathering can only be conducted with complete detachment.
  Therefore, social scientists who were among those peers are likely to believe that social scientists do not need to be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The peers in line 22 are described as social scientists who have a specific view towards what constitutes legitimate research.
  Dunham is described as breaking with the views of these peers by becoming closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  Moreover, the passage suggests that the research-to-performance method Dunham developed was able to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would most likely agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
In the passage, the author presents the view that dance was neglected as an area of social research because of the lack of experts in social science and dance, with existing began outside of academia. Katherine Dunham's success in performing the research is attributed to her approach to research, where she participated in the dances herself and thereby attained complex cultural practices. Thus, the "peers" mentioned in line 22 would most likely disagree with the view that dance research should be conducted from a position of complete detachment. This view is expressed in Choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The peers mentioned in line 22 refer to other social scientists.
  According to the passage, dance was neglected as a subject of social research before Katherine Dunham.
  The passage states that no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
  Based on the above, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are colleagues in anthropology.
  They may not have appreciated Katherine Dunham's field work method that involves participation rather than detachment.
  Therefore, their opinion likely reflects their perspective on data gathering procedures in anthropology.
  Choice (B) suggests that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data, which aligns with the concept of scientific rigor.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions colleagues in anthropology mentioned in line 22.
  These colleagues advised Dunham not to become closely involved in the dances she was observing and to obtain data gathering from a position of complete detachment.
  Based on this context, the peers mentioned in line 22 were likely to hold this same view.
  Therefore, the correct answer should be consistent with this view, suggesting that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted from a position of close personal involvement.
  Only one of the answer choices is consistent with this view.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the challenges Dunham faced in conducting research on dance due to the lack of recognition of dance as an area of social research.
  Her colleagues advised against becoming too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The peers mentioned in line 22 likely shared the same view as Dunham's colleagues.
  Hence, the peers mentioned would have most likely believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The correct answer is (B) because it is the only statement that reflects this view.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  The reason for the neglect is given as the fact that previously most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
  The peers refer to social scientists.
  Therefore, the peers think that dance cannot be considered a legitimate area of social research.
  Choice C best reflects the above reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The peers mentioned in line 22 are social scientists.
  The passage suggests that dance had previously been neglected as an area of social research due to the lack of trained social scientists in the methods of dance.
  The previous methodology in social research was one that prioritized complete detachment from the subject of study.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how dance was neglected as a field of social research before Katherine Dunham's work.
  The passage also mentions the prevailing methodology in social science during that time.
  It suggests that Dunham's approach diverged radically from the prevailing methodology.
  Peers, as mentioned in line 22, refer to social scientists.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that peers would have been most likely to agree with the statement that "Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.".

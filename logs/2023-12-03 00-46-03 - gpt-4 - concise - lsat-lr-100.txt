Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Thought:
The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola is more favorable than the competing colas tested. The reasoning does not consider other factors or scenarios that could affect the preference. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola is more favorable than the competing colas based on the test results. However, there may be other colas that were not tested in the study that could be more favorable than Sparkle Cola.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The advertisement implies that Sparkle Cola is better than the tested competing colas based on the volunteers' preferences.
- The reasoning is vulnerable if there's a possibility that another factor, not tested in the study, could affect the preference.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested. However, it does not account for other colas that were not part of the test.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than the competing colas tested. However, it does not consider the possibility that there could be other colas not tested in the study that could have elicited a more favorable response.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: The advertisement compares Sparkle Cola to five competing colas and concludes that it's more favorable than any of the competing colas tested. However, the advertisement does not consider that there might be a cola not tested that could be more favorable than Sparkle Cola.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The advertisement's claim is that Sparkle Cola is more favorable than the competing colas tested.
  The advertisement does not consider the possibility of untested colas being more favorable.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The advertisement shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than the competing colas tested, but it did not test all other colas. The reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there may be better options among colas that were not tested.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: The advertisement assumes that Sparkle Cola is better than all competing colas based on the study, without considering other colas that were not tested.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola is preferred over other colas based on the study conducted. However, it does not take into account other colas that were not part of the study.

Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument is assuming that if one condition leads to another condition, then the presence of the latter condition means the presence of the first condition. In other words, if squirrels eat from a bird feeder (condition A) it will not attract many birds (condition B), but having condition B only happens if condition A is present.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the given argument is about drawing conclusions from conditions that are necessary but not sufficient.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument is the assumption that a single condition (in this case, the lack of a protective cover) necessarily leads to the undesired outcome (not attracting many birds). 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern in the original argument is that squirrels eating from the bird feeder doesn't necessarily mean the bird feeder cannot attract many birds unless it lacks a protective cover. There might be other reasons why a bird feeder doesn't attract many birds.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument is that it describes a situation where a condition leads to an outcome, but only under certain circumstances. The argument implies a direct connection without considering other factors that may affect the situation.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: Both the original argument and the answer choice need to have a flawed pattern of reasoning and a similar structure.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The original argument assumes that if squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover then a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. It's a reversal of the cause and effect.
  
  With the choices given, we must find the one with the same flawed pattern of reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern in the original argument is that it assumes if one condition (squirrels eating from bird feeder) is met, then another condition (not attracting many birds) must also be present when there can be other factors involved.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
In the context, the argument says that squirrels will eat from bird feeders only if they lack a protective cover, and therefore, bird feeders will not attract many birds if they lack a protective cover. This matches how some arguments could have an incomplete correlation, possibly leading to an inaccurate conclusion.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The flaw in the original argument: It assumes that the lack of a protective cover is the only reason squirrels eat from bird feeders and doesn't consider other possibilities or causes.
  
  Identify the argument with the same flawed pattern:

  A: Assumes tires will last longer if the car owner checks tire pressure, but doesn't consider other factors to tire wear.
  B: Establishes neglecting pressure check leads to low tire pressure, which then causes premature wear, same direction as the original argument.
  C: Talks about making car owners aware of the consequences, doesn't have the same pattern.
  D: Establishes neglecting pressure check leads to low tire pressure, which then causes premature wear, same direction as the original argument.
  E: Acknowledges multiple causes for premature wear but assumes that low pressure doesn't help when driven on gravel roads.

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought: The reasoning above is linking watching too much television with the overestimation of being a victim of a natural disaster. To weaken this argument, we should look for a choice that shows another reason for the link or shows that television is not causing the overestimation.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The statement says that people who watch above-average television are more likely to think they'll be victims of natural disasters. If we find out that a person who watches above-average amount of television is more likely to live in an area prone to natural disasters, then their belief of being more likely to be victims has a logical basis. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question asks for a choice that weakens the reasoning that watching too much television leads to overestimating risks.
  Choice E states that people in disaster-prone areas are more likely to watch more television, which could imply that their perception of risk isn't only due to watching television but also because of their living situation.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: The question and context are about weakening the findings of the study. Since the study found that people who watch more television think they will be victims of natural disasters, we should find an option that weakens this view.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that people who watch above-average amounts of television overestimate their likelihood of being victims of a natural disaster. We are looking for a statement that weakens this argument.

  A: This merely states a fact without addressing the link between television and overestimation.
  B: If true, this shows that there is a correlation between a person's likelihood to live in a disaster-prone area and their television habits. This does not weaken the argument.
  C: This reinforces the argument because it assumes that people who watch less television have a better idea of their likelihood of being victims.
  D: This is irrelevant to the argument's link between television and overestimation.
  E: This choice directly undermines the argument's link between television and overestimation. If people who live in disaster-prone areas watch more television, their overestimation might be due to their environment, and not their television-watching habits.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question is about weakening the reasoning that watching too much TV leads to overestimating the risks of being victims of natural disasters. So, we should look for an option that undermines the correlation between TV watching and risk perception.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  To weaken the reasoning, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the correlation between watching more television and believing they will be a victim of a natural disaster.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument is based on the idea that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. We need to find an option that weakens this argument.

Option A does not weaken the argument, as it just states that many people overestimate the dangers regardless of television.
Option B is not directly related to the argument, as it talks about different living areas as criteria for TV watch time.
Option C supports the argument as it infers that people who watch less TV have a more accurate idea about the risk.
Option D states that being well informed about risks is not related to watching television, which does not weaken the argument directly.
Option E weakens the argument, as it implies that people living in disaster-prone areas are more likely to watch more television, so their estimation of risks may be justified rather than exaggerated due to TV.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The reasoning states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. To weaken this claim, we should find a reason that disassociates television watching from the overestimation of risks.

  We need to weaken the connection between watching an above-average amount of television and overestimating the risks of being a victim of a natural disaster.

Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole

Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that publishing a scholarly journal has become more profitable due to increased subscription rates paid by libraries. To weaken this argument, we need to find information that contradicts the idea that journal publishing has become more profitable. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that journal subscription rates increased dramatically while costs remained constant, meaning the publishing of a scholarly journal is more profitable now.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that shows an alternative reason for the increase in subscription rates.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the increasing subscription rates for university libraries imply increased profit for publishers of scholarly journals. To weaken the argument, we must find a reason that disproves the claimed correlation between subscription rates and profit.

  Choice D presents the possibility that the publishers are primarily getting their revenue from individuals, and since individual subscription rates have remained unchanged, it would mean that the profit margin for publishers has not necessarily increased as mentioned in the argument.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now due to increased subscription rates paid by libraries. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that indicates the publishers are not necessarily making more profit or are not the ones benefiting from the increased subscription rates.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that increased subscription rates for libraries must mean increased profit for journal publishers. To weaken the argument, we need to find a reason why the higher rates do not necessarily mean higher profits.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that publishing a scholarly journal must be more profitable now due to increased subscription rates for university libraries, even though the costs of publishing have remained fairly constant.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a choice that shows why profits may not have increased despite the higher subscription rates.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument says that higher subscription rates paid by university libraries must have increased the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal. If the number of paying subscribers has not increased, this would seriously weaken the argument.

Context: Psychologist: Doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia. Most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are known to be caused by psychological stress. This suggests that insomniacs do not need drugs that alter their biochemistry, but rather need psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia.
Question: Each of the following describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
  B: It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress.
  C: It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress.
  E: It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia.
Response 0:
Thought: The statement claims that doctors should not prescribe sedatives for insomnia because most cases treated by psychologists are caused by stress. The flaws describe potential issues with this reasoning, except one.

A: It makes a presumption about insomnia and stress, but this is a flaw.
B: This is a flaw because it ignores other potential treatments.
C: This flaw points out that psychotherapy may not be effective for everyone.

Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that by recording staff errors, the hospitals' staffs became more meticulous in their duties, leading to a decrease in patient injuries.
  The statement that strengthens the argument should demonstrate a direct correlation between recording the errors and staff diligence in their duties or the decrease in patient injuries.

  The CEO acknowledges that they have reduced pollution but does not consider that there may be other methods that produce even less pollution than their current method. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The CEO believes that their corporation is environmentally responsible. They have changed production methods to pollute less and argues that there aren't any pollution-free methods currently.
  The flaw in the argument is that the CEO might not be aware of other existing methods that could produce less pollution.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The CEO argues that they are environmentally responsible because they have reduced pollution and there are currently no methods without pollution. This ignores the possibility that there might be methods which produce even less pollution than their current methods.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The CEO claims that they are environmentally responsible because they pollute less than before and there are no pollution-free methods available.
  The flaw is that they assume no further improvements can be made.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The CEO's argument is flawed because they assume that just because they have improved their production methods to pollute less, it means they are an environmentally responsible corporation. However, they don't consider whether there are currently other methods that would allow them to produce less pollution.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The CEO claims that the corporation is environmentally responsible because they have reduced pollution, but there might be other methods to reduce pollution further.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The CEO argues that they are environmentally responsible because they have reduced pollution with current production methods, but there are no pollution-free methods available. 

  The CEO's argument assumes there are no other methods that could produce less pollution than their current methods, even if they aren't entirely pollution-free.

Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Thought: Larew argues that because the lowest income quintile experienced a higher percentage increase in average income, their economic prosperity improved relative to the highest quintile.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Thought: The Figorian Wildlife Commission is arguing that future wetland development should be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. For their argument to work, they must assume that the species living in the original wetlands can survive in the newly created ones.

Context: In order to relieve traffic congestion, the city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area. However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps, to explain the increase in average commute time?
Choices:
  A: Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs.
  B: The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  C: Shortly after the new highway was opened, several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights.
  D: At the same time the new highway was being built,. road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner.
  E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If road repair work was happening on the important streets leading to downtown Gastner during the same time the new highway was being built, this would explain why the average commute time increased even after the new highway opened, as the repairs could slow down traffic and prolong commutes.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The average commute time increased in the downtown area after the new highway opened.
  The most important factor in causing an increase in commute time would be a change in traffic conditions during the same time period.

Action: Answer("D")

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that unless there is stronger evidence or admission, the penalty cannot be imposed due to its severity and the level of certainty needed regarding the polluter's identity.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument's reasoning revolves around the penalty being severe and requiring stronger evidence or admission of guilt before imposing it. The principle in choice A connects the severity of the penalty to the certainty required before imposing it.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  In the argument, it is stated that unless stronger evidence is found or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the severe penalty. This aligns with the principle that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt before imposing the penalty.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument mentions that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, imposing the penalty is not justified because of the severity of the penalty.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  In the context, it states that there must be stronger evidence or an admission of guilt before imposing the severe penalty. This corresponds to the idea that one must be more certain of guilt before imposing a severe penalty.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
The argument states that stronger evidence is needed to justify imposing the penalty on the perpetrator. This implies a principle that the severity of the penalty must match the certainty of guilt. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that because the penalty for pollution is severe, there must be stronger evidence before imposing the penalty. This statement aligns with the idea that greater certainty is needed before imposing a more severe penalty on someone.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is about the need for stronger evidence or admission of guilt before imposing a severe penalty. The principle that corresponds to this reasoning is related to the level of certainty required before imposing severe penalties.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument states that we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty because the penalty is severe.

Action: Answer("A")

Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.
  B: Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  C: An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of.
  D: An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature.
  E: A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The legislator's proposal is to spend the extra money from water bills on building new roads instead of building a dam.
  The columnist's judgment that the proposal is unacceptable can be justified by the principle that a water utility should only collect additional charges for water-related expenditures.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The legislator's proposal is to use the additional charge from water bills for building roads instead of a dam.
  The principle that fits best here is that the money collected from an additional charge by a water utility should be used for water-related matters.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The principle needed to justify the columnist's judgment must show that the funds generated should be spent on water-related projects rather than non-water-related projects like roads. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The columnist considers the proposal to be unacceptable likely because the original purpose of collecting the additional charge was to build a dam. Using that revenue for another project, such as building new roads, would be a departure from the original intent.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The original approval was for collecting an additional charge to build a dam, which is a water-related project.
  The legislator's proposal is to use the extra money for building new roads, which is not a water-related project.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The columnist disagrees with using the additional charge collected from water bills for building new roads instead of the dam.
  The best justification for this opinion could be:
  A water utility should not collect additional charges unless used for water-related expenses.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The columnist's judgment is that the legislator's proposal to spend the extra money from water bills on roads is unacceptable. The principle that justifies this judgment should relate to the purpose of the additional charge and its use.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The issue is the proposed use of the additional charge in the water bills.
  The unacceptable proposal is to spend the extra money on building new roads rather than the dam.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The government-owned water utility wants to build a dam, and the additional charge on water bills is approved for this purpose. The legislator wants to use the extra money to build roads instead, which are unrelated to water.

Response 9:
Thought:
  The legislator's proposal involves redirecting the funds from a water-related project (building a dam) to a non-water-related project (building new roads), contradicting the reason for collecting the additional charge on water bills.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that most people switching to Popelka Auto Insurance saved $250 a year, on average. It concludes that most people with other insurance policies could save by switching to Popelka. The most vulnerable criticism would be that the sample is not representative of the general population.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument relies on the assumption that the sample of new policyholders is representative of all people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies. This assumption is not necessarily valid, and it would be vulnerable to criticism if the new Popelka policyholders were not representative of the broader population of auto insurance policyholders.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most people can save money by switching to Popelka based on a survey of new policyholders.
  This statement is vulnerable to criticism if the survey sample is not actually representative of the general population.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that most people could save by switching to Popelka based on the sample of new Popelka policyholders, not considering other factors affecting the savings.
  The argument fails to address the possibility of biased representation among the surveyed new policyholders.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the savings observed in the sample of new Popelka policyholders are representative of the potential savings for all other policyholders in different companies. However, the sample might be skewed or disproportionate.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The advertisement uses the experiences of new Popelka policyholders as a basis for claiming that most people could save money by switching.
  The argument assumes that the sampled policyholders are representative of everyone who could potentially switch.
  The advertisement may not acknowledge that the sampled policyholders might be more likely to have switched because they saved more money than the general population.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on a sample of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders, so it may not be representative of all auto insurance policyholders with other companies. The argument assumes that most people could save by switching to Popelka but doesn't consider other factors.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The advertisement is based on a survey of new Popelka policyholders. The argument might not hold true for all auto insurance policyholders, as the new Popelka policyholders could be biased towards those who save more.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: The advertisement's argument is vulnerable because it assumes that the sample is representative of all auto insurance policyholders, which may not be the case. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argue that natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering the brain. We need to find a choice that supports this position.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors believes that the brain's natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering the brain. We need to find the choice that supports their position.

Choices analysis:
  A: This choice doesn't support the second group's position because it talks about the treatment's lack of negative side effects rather than focusing on the brain's defenses against bilirubin.
  B: This choice might support the argument that bilirubin can enter brains, but it doesn't support the idea that the brain's natural defenses normally prevent it.
  C: This choice talks about the presence of bilirubin in other fluids; however, it doesn't address the brain's natural defenses preventing bilirubin from entering.
  D: This choice supports the second group's position because it states that bilirubin has a positive effect on newborns, neutralizing damaging substances at birth.
  E: This choice is about the doctors' agreement on high levels of bilirubin, not about the brain's natural defenses preventing it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: The question asks for a statement that supports the position of the second group of doctors, who argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high because the brain's natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering. Choice D states that bilirubin neutralizes potentially damaging substances, which can be seen as an argument for allowing bilirubin levels to remain high.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We need to find a statement that supports the position of the second group of doctors who argue for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high.

  Choice A shows that the treatment is safe but doesn't support the second group's position.
  Choice B suggests a reason when bilirubin levels could be harmful, rather it points out the need for treatment.
  Choice C explains where bilirubin occurs but doesn't argue for leaving it high in newborns.
  Choice D presents a positive role of bilirubin for newborns, which supports the second group's position.
  Choice E talks about the general agreement among doctors, but it doesn't support the second group's position.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argue for allowing high levels of bilirubin because the brain's natural defenses prevent it from entering the brain. We need to find evidence that supports the idea of not treating high bilirubin levels in newborns.

Choices:
  A: Does not support the second group, as it talks about no side effects from the treatment.
  B: Suggests that only certain diseases may allow bilirubin to enter, which could indirectly support the second group.
  C: Provides additional information about bilirubin's presence elsewhere, but does not help support the second group's position.
  D: Positively associates bilirubin with neutralizing harmful substances, which supports the second group's position.
  E: Does not support the second group, as it discusses consensus among those who recommend treatment.

Action: Answer("D")

Response 7:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering. We need to find a statement that supports their position.

  A: This choice doesn't support the second group's position, as it talks about the treatment being free of negative side effects.
  B: This choice mentions a situation in which bilirubin could enter the brain, but it doesn't directly support the second group's argument that natural defenses normally prevent this.
  C: While this choice provides information about where bilirubin is found in newborns, it doesn't support or refute the second group's position.
  D: This choice supports the second group's position by providing a reason for keeping bilirubin levels high - it has a protective function for newborns.
  E: This choice discusses agreement among doctors on high bilirubin levels, but it doesn't directly support the second group's position.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argue that the brain's natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering, and high levels of bilirubin in newborns should be allowed.

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The conclusion drawn is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. We need to find the choice that is least helpful in establishing this conclusion. Let's evaluate each choice:

  A: The same number of people in each group helps in making a fair comparison.

  B: The same group of researchers answering the calls ensures consistency.

  C: Among the college students, there were no persons more than forty years old. This choice is not helpful in establishing the conclusion as it doesn't provide information about the age relation with memory.

  D: Unrestricted access to telephones ensures that the calls can be made without any hindrance.

  E: Receiving instructions at the same time ensures that both groups receive equal opportunity and time to remember.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  A: Ensures fair comparison.
  D: Ensures equal access to the task.
  E: Ensures equal time to remember the task.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We need to find the choice that is least helpful in supporting the conclusion that one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  Establishing if the conclusion is properly drawn mainly depends on eliminating factors that could introduce bias or inaccuracies in the study.
    
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: The conclusion focuses on the memory performance of the two groups. Information relevant to the study conditions, group sizes, and how calls were made or received is essential for judging the conclusion. Answer choice C, which focuses on college students' ages, does not help establish the conclusion because it is not related to memory performance in this context.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is about memory in relation to age, and we want to find the least helpful choice in establishing that conclusion.

  A: This point controls the group size, making the comparison fair.
  B: Researchers answering the calls doesn't relate to memory or age directly.
  C: This information helps establish the age gap between the groups.
  D: This ensures both groups had equal opportunity to make calls.
  E: Ensures instructions were given at similar times to both groups for fair comparison.

Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The ethicist's conclusion is that we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action when we know a lot about the events leading up to it. The assumption that would enable this conclusion is that we can only justify praise or blame when we regard the action as freely performed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The ethicist's argument focuses on the idea that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action may justify praising or blaming a person for that action. Tolstoy's claim focuses on the idea that knowing a lot would make us cease to regard the action as freely performed. The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim must be rejected. 

  To link the conclusion and premise, we need an assumption that connects the justification of praise or blame with the perceived freedom of an action. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we can't accept Tolstoy's claim because sometimes we are justified in praising or blaming a person for their actions.
  To properly draw this conclusion, we need to link the action with being freely performed since Tolstoy's claim revolves around the idea that knowing a lot would make us stop regarding the action as freely performed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Ethicist's argument: To be justified in praising or blaming someone, one needs to know a lot about the events leading to an action, but this doesn't make the action less freely performed. 

To draw the proper conclusion, we need to find an assumption that connects knowing a lot about events leading to an action and still considering the action freely performed when praising or blaming a person for it.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The ethicist's conclusion is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim.
  To reach this conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the justification of praise or blame with the perception of free will in actions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The ethicist's argument conclusion is that we should reject Tolstoy's claim.
  To be able to properly reach that conclusion, we need an assumption that connects our justification for praising or blaming a person with the concept of "freely performed" actions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The ethicist's conclusion is to reject Tolstoy's claim that if we know a lot about the events leading up to an action, we would stop regarding the action as freely performed. So, the premise needed should directly relate to this conclusion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
- The ethicist states that we can only praise or blame someone when we know a lot about the events leading up to the action.
- Tolstoy claims that knowing a lot about the events would make us not see the action as freely performed.
- The ethicist's conclusion rejects Tolstoy's claim.

Thought: The conclusion of the ethicist's argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim. In order to properly draw this conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the idea of knowing a lot about events leading up to an action and regarding that action as freely performed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The ethicist's argument states that we need to know a lot about the events leading to an action to justify praising or blaming a person. The argument opposes Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to an action, we would not regard it as freely performed. The conclusion here relies on the idea that praising or blaming a person is dependent on the perception of the action being freely performed.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The economists' assertion is about solving urbanization problems by trading goods or services produced by the urban population to obtain agricultural products.
  We need to find the statement that most supports this assertion.
  
  A: Talks about government subsidies to urban manufacturers, but not directly about trading for agricultural products.
  B: Is a general statement about economic causes and solutions, not specific to the assertion.
  C: Indicates that scarcity of agricultural products is a major problem in urbanization; solving this through trade would support the assertion.
  D: Discusses the migration issue being due to trade imbalances, but not specifically about trading for agricultural products as a solution.
  E: Mentions free trade policies exacerbating problems, which is not in support of the economists' assertion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  To support the economists' assertion that trading services and goods produced by urban population can effectively solve problems resulting from urbanization, we need to find evidence that shows the effectiveness of such exchange processes.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The economists' assertion is that trading goods or services produced by an urban population can solve problems resulting from urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we should find a statement that demonstrates a direct benefit or solution from this trade.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The economists' assertion suggests trading goods/services produced by an urban population to obtain agricultural products.
  The best support would be an option that shows this trading will address a central element of urbanization problems.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The economists' assertion is that trading goods or services produced by an urban population can solve problems caused by increasing urbanization.
  
  Choice C states that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems caused by urbanization. If true, addressing this scarcity through trade would provide support for the economists' assertion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that trading goods or services from a predominantly urban population to obtain agricultural products can solve problems caused by urbanization. The most support comes from a statement that explains the scarcity of agricultural products is a central issue.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The economists' assertion is about trading goods and services produced by urban population to obtain agricultural products.
  The most supportive statement would highlight the importance of obtaining agricultural products for solving urbanization problems.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The economists' assertion is that trading goods produced by urban populations can solve problems resulting from urbanization.
  
  Comparing the choices:

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Thought: The pharmacist's argument is that melatonin supplements alleviate insomnia's symptoms in older people, and therefore the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages must be correct. The flaw in the argument is that it is confusing the effect of melatonin supplementation with the cause of reduced melatonin production in the pineal gland.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist's argument is that since melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in older individuals, the claims of the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages must be correct. This argument conflates the effect of melatonin supplementation (improved sleep) with the cause of insomnia (potentially decreased melatonin production).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument is that since melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms in elderly people, the manufacturers' claim about the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages is correct. This argument confuses the effect of melatonin (alleviating insomnia) with the cause of the reduced production of melatonin in the pineal gland as people age.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because melatonin aids in alleviating insomnia's symptoms. The argument assumes that since melatonin is helpful, the pineal gland must produce less melatonin as it ages. However, this is flawed – just because melatonin is helpful for symptoms, it doesn't necessarily mean that the pineal gland produces less of it with age.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: The pharmacist's argument concludes that the manufacturers' claims are correct based on the study showing melatonin aids in alleviating insomnia symptoms. The argument confuses the effect of melatonin supplements with the cause of decreased melatonin production. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims of manufacturers about the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages are correct based on the fact that ingesting melatonin helps alleviate insomnia symptoms in older people. This confuses an effect of a phenomenon (ingesting melatonin) with its cause (the pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist's argument is that since melatonin supplements help alleviate insomnia symptoms in the elderly, the manufacturers' claims that melatonin production decreases with age are correct. This argument confuses an effect of a phenomenon (the alleviation of insomnia symptoms) with its cause (the decrease in melatonin production with age).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: The pharmacist's argument is confusing an effect (melatonin alleviating insomnia) with its cause (pineal gland producing less melatonin as it ages).

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the alleviation of symptoms means that the manufacturers' claims about the reduced production of melatonin are true. It may not necessarily mean that the cause of insomnia in older people is because of the lesser production of melatonin by the pineal gland. Thus, it confuses the effect with its cause.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The pharmacist assumed that if the melatonin supplement can alleviate insomnia symptoms in older adults, then the pineal gland must produce less melatonin as it ages. This reasoning confuses the effect of melatonin supplements with the cause of decreased melatonin production.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for a counter to the physician's claim that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain because the treated group had a significant reduction in pain. Identifying a potential issue with the experimental design or another explanation for the relief will be the strongest counter.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is based on the experiment results, which show that magnets are effective at relieving back pain.
  The strongest counter to this argument would be something that undermines the experiment's credibility or introduces an alternative explanation.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: The most logical counter to the physician's argument would involve an explanation that doesn't rely on the magnetic field but still accounts for the reduction in pain in the first group.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain, based on the experiment. The strongest counter would be an alternative explanation for the improvement in condition for the patients who received magnet treatment.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The physician concludes that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment.
  The best counter to this argument would address potential problems in the experiment that could lead to the observed results and dispute the conclusion drawn from it.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the effectiveness of magnet therapy.
  A : Addresses improvement due to knowing a treatment was applied.
  B : Discusses medication as an alternative.
  C : Talks about experiments related to pain in other areas.
  D : Mentions scientists' beliefs before the experiment.
  E : Describes variation in the causes of back pain.
  The logically strongest counter would be the one that undermines the conclusion based on the experiment.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that magnets probably alleviate some back pain based on the results of the experiment. The strongest counter argument would be a factor that questions the reliability of the experiment's results.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is based on the experiment showing that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment's results.

Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The new program counted paychecks per pay period, not unique employees.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  Therefore, employees could be counted multiple times, leading to overestimation of the number of employed people.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The new program counted paychecks as an estimation of employed people.
  The first quarter involved multiple paychecks for some employees for regular, overtime, and bonuses.
  This means the estimation of people employed was higher than the actual number, as one person could have multiple paychecks.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The new program counts the number of paychecks to estimate employment.
  Some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the hours worked, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  This means the number of paychecks would be higher than the number of people employed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The new program counted the number of paychecks per pay period as an estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter of using the program, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
  This means the program likely overcounted the number of people employed, resulting in overestimation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The new program counted the number of paychecks per pay period as an employment estimate. 
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and other incentives. 
  Therefore, the new program possibly counted the same employee multiple times, leading to an overestimate.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period to estimate employment.
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses.
  This means the computer program would have counted more paychecks than actual employees for these cases.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
- The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period.
- A large increase in the number of people employed was reported for the first quarter the program was used.
- Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.

Conclusion: Because the program counted the number of paychecks rather than unique employees, the reported growth in employment was inflated.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The new computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period as an estimate of employment.
  In the first quarter, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  This means that the number of paychecks per pay period was higher than the number of people employed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The new program counted the number of paychecks per pay period to estimate employment.
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  Therefore, the program counted some employees multiple times.

Response 9:
Thought:
  Information given: 
    - New program tallies the number of paychecks issued per pay period. 
    - Government reported a large increase in the number of people employed in the quarter when the program was used. 
    - In the first quarter of the program's use, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses/commissions.
  
From the given information, since the new program counts paychecks and each employee was receiving multiple paychecks for different reasons, it will lead to overestimating the total number of people employed.

  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the total sales of hair dryers have stayed constant during the 5 years. However, it overlooks the possibility that the total sales of hair dryers might have increased or declined, leading to the conclusion for Wilson Appliance Company's net income.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that declining market share means lower net income. However, it doesn't take into account the possibility that the total market for hair dryers may have grown, which would mean Wilson Appliance's net income could remain the same or even increase.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the total number of hair dryers sold remains unchanged, which is not explicitly mentioned.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that Wilson Appliance's net income from sales has dropped because of the decline in its market share. However, it doesn't consider factors like an increase in the retail price of the product or a change in total sales of hair dryers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Wilson's market share has dropped from 50% to 25% but the average net income per hair dryer has remained the same. It concludes that the company's net income from hair dryer sales is half of what it was 5 years ago. The flaw in this reasoning is that it doesn't take into account the possibility of an increase in the retail price or increased total sales over the past 5 years.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the declining market share automatically means Wilson Appliance's net income from their hair dryer sales has declined. It doesn't take into account other factors that could have changed, like the overall market for hair dryers or the price of the product.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument's flaw is that it assumes the total sales of hair dryers have remained constant over the past 5 years, whereas there could be other factors affecting sales.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's market share has decreased, but it does not consider whether the total sales in the market have changed. If the total sales have increased, even with the decreased market share, it may not be true that the company's net income has halved.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that because the market share has decreased and the net income per hair dryer sold has remained the same, the net income must be half of what it was 5 years ago. However, it does not take into account the possibility that total sales (not just market share) and/or the retail price could have changed in the last 5 years.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The argument focuses on the decrease in market share and constant net income per hair dryer sold.
- The argument assumes that total sales of the product have decreased.

Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguanas on the islands near Australia must have come from the Americas by rafting on floating debris.
  
  To weaken this argument, we should look for an alternative explanation for the presence of the iguana species on the islands.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument states that the progenitors of the iguana species must have rafted from the Americas to the islands.
  Weakening this argument will require information that suggests an alternative way the iguanas ended up on the islands.

Response 2:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument states that the iguana species' progenitors rafted across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas to the islands near Australia.
  The information that weakens this argument should suggest an alternative origin of these species.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands near Australia have ancestors who rafted from the Americas. The argument would be weakened if there was evidence suggesting another way these species might have ended up on the islands or if the connection to the Americas was less direct. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the progenitors of the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris from the Americas based on the islands' formation and the species' distribution. We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.

  A: Not all animal species on the islands are found in the Americas does not affect the iguana rafting argument.
  B: Genetic differences between the iguanas on the islands and in the Americas do not necessarily disprove the rafting argument.
  C: Iguana rafting being uncommon does not rule out the possibility that it happened.
  D: Fossils of related iguana species in Australia would provide potential evidence for a different dispersal method and create an alternative possibility to the rafting argument.
  E: Lineages of other species dating back to Gondwana does not impact the iguana rafting argument.

Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is about the safety of bicyclists on roads with bicycle lanes and on roads without them.
  It comes to a conclusion based on statistics about collisions.
  The argument doesn't consider other factors that might influence numbers or safety, like the number of bicyclists on these roads.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that more collisions occur on roads having designated bicycle lanes than roads without such lanes. It assumes that adding lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance bicyclists' safety. The main issue with the argument is that it doesn't consider the number of bicyclists using those roads.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes than on roads without them, but it does not mention the number of bicyclists riding on each type of road. If there are more bicyclists on roads with designated lanes, then the higher number of collisions could be due to that factor.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument compares the number of bicycle-vehicle collisions with or without bicycle lanes.
  It does not consider the total number of bicyclists on the roads with such lanes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that more collisions occur on roads with bicycle lanes and thus adding lanes won't enhance safety. 

  Choice B: suggests that the argument doesn't consider the possibility of more bicyclists riding on roads with lanes, which could impact the statistics.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is suggesting that adding bicycle lanes won't enhance safety because there are more collisions in roads with designated bicycle lanes. However, it doesn't consider the number of cyclists on each type of road (with or without lanes).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that adding bike lanes will not make bicyclists safer due to more accidents on roads with bike lanes. The flaw might be due to not considering other factors, such as the number of bicyclists using the roads.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the statistics of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles. The criticism should focus on a factor that could be responsible for such statistics and overlooked by the argument.

Choices Analysis:
  A: It does not directly support the statement about the relationship between bees' vision and flower colors.
  B: This choice doesn't address why flowers evolved their colors in response to bees' vision.
  C: The number of species does not directly support the statement about the flowers evolving in response to bees' vision.
  D: Although it shows a relationship between bees and nonflowering plants, it doesn't support the flowers' color development.
  E: This choice indicates a strong relationship between bees and flowers, supporting the idea that the flower colors evolved in response to bees' vision.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, it means that flowers adapted to suit bees' vision to attract them. The choices need to support that flowers developed to cater to bees' vision.

  Analyzing choices:
  A: This choice does not directly relate to flowers and their color development for bees.
  B: Relying on other insects doesn't necessarily support that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  C: The number of species doesn't necessarily provide support for the statement about the development of flower color in response to bees' vision.
  D: Nonflowering plants are not relevant to the claim regarding flower color development for bees.
  E: If bees rely exclusively on flowers for food, it supports that flowers might have developed their colors in response to bees' vision to attract them.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
Needed: Evidence that supports the idea that flowers developed their colors in response to bees' vision.

A: Does not support the statement, it talks about other insects not depending on object's color.
B: Does not support the statement, it mentions other insects, not related to bees' vision.
C: Does not support the statement, focuses on species numbers instead of the development of flower colors and bees' vision.
D: Does not support the statement, focuses on nonflowering plants and bees, not the development of flower colors and bees' vision.
E: Supports the statement, as it shows that bees solely depend on flowers for their food, which can explain flowers developing colors that enhance bees' perception.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  Choice B tells us that some flowers rely on other insects, but it doesn't prove the given statement.
  Choice C has no direct correlation to the adaptation or development of either the bee's vision or the flowers.
  Choice D, about nonflowering plants relying on bees, doesn't support the claim about bees' vision and flower color.
  Choice E suggests that bees depend on flowers for their food, meaning flowers might have developed their colors to increase their chances of attracting bees.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  To support the statement that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, we need to find an answer choice that shows a strong correlation between bees' vision and flower evolution.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The statement suggests flowers adapted to bees' vision rather than the other way around. To support this, we need information that indicates a relationship between flower color and bees' vision. 

Choice E focuses on present-day bees but doesn't relate flower color to bees' vision, so it's not the best answer.

Choice D is about nonflowering plants and bees, not about flower color and bees' vision.

Choice A discusses many insects with similar vision but doesn't talk about the relationship between flower color and bees' vision.

Choice B only says that some flowers rely on other insects, but doesn't provide a direct connection between bees' vision and flower color.

Choice C suggests that there are more species of flowers than species of bees. This could imply that flowers needed to diversify and adapt themselves to attract bees instead of bees adapting to the color of the flowers.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The statement suggests that flowers evolved in response to bees' vision, not the other way around.
  If this is true, then something about flowers should have developed with bees and their vision in mind.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: The statement above suggests that flowers evolved in response to bees' vision rather than the other way around. We need to find evidence supporting this notion.

Choices analysis: 
  A: This option talks about other insects and doesn't focus on the relationship between bees and flowers.
  B: Focusing on other insects doesn't directly address the evolution of flowers in response to bees' vision.
  C: Although this states there are more flower species than bee species, it doesn't explain the reason behind their evolution.
  D: This option talks about nonflowering plants relying on bees, which is irrelevant to the statement.
  E: This supports the idea that flowers evolved to accommodate bees' vision since bees rely exclusively on flowers for food.

Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument provided talks about something being good for individuals (a fish-based diet), but not being sustainable for the masses, as it could lead to extinction (negative consequences).

Action: Answer("C")

Reason:
  Choice C discusses that limiting purchases and saving or investing income would be good for individuals, but if everyone did it, it would lead to negative consequences like a severe economic recession. This reasoning closely resembles the original argument.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The original argument presents a situation where adopting a healthier diet could have negative consequences, making it impossible for everyone to adopt it. Therefore, it is not recommended for everyone.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
- In the context paragraph, the argument states that while adopting a fish-based diet seems to be healthy, it would result in an unsustainable situation (the extinction of marine species). So, universal adoption is not recommended.
- We need to find an argument that also shows a seemingly good idea but could lead to an unsustainable situation.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument asserts that adopting a fish-based diet universally would lead to extinction of marine species, rendering the diet impossible for everyone. It states the potential benefits of adopting a fish-based diet but also highlights the unintended negative consequences if everyone were to follow it.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: Choice C talks about limiting purchases and saving or investing remaining income. It highlights the benefits of such a spending pattern, but then also mentions the unintended negative consequences of everyone adopting this pattern, which would lead to a severe recession. This reasoning closely resembles that of the argument above.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument above states that adopting a diet based on fish would be beneficial for health, but would cause negative consequences for the marine species. Similarly, we need an argument that suggests a benefit while highlighting potential negative consequences if universally adopted.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The original argument states that a certain action (switching to a fish-based diet) is healthier but would lead to a negative outcome (extinction of marine species) and therefore should not be universally recommended. We need to find the choice with a similar reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The original argument says that adopting a healthier diet based on fish is not recommended for everyone because it would make marine species extinct, making the diet impossible. The reasoning involves the idea that something good or beneficial for individuals might have negative consequences if universally adopted.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: The argument in the context says that a healthier diet might have vast negative consequences for the environment, making it impossible to recommend for everyone. This line of reasoning is most comparable to an argument acknowledging the benefits of an action, but then highlighting broader consequences that would make the action undesirable if universally adopted.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The original argument states that while a certain action (healthy diet based on fish) has a positive effect, the consequences of everyone adopting that action (marine species extinction) makes it a bad recommendation.

Action: Answer("C")

Reasoning: 
  Choice C presents the same structure: a certain action (limiting purchases) has positive effects for an individual, but the consequences of everyone adopting it (severe recession) makes it a bad recommendation.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is about the consequences of universally adopting a certain action, stating that recommending a healthy diet based on fish protein can have negative consequences for marine species. So, we need to find a similar argument that addresses the recommendation of an action and its potential unintended negative consequences.

Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought:
The employee's argument uses an analogy, comparing office distractions from website filters to office decorations and windows.
We need to find an argument that also uses analogy to compare one situation to another in a similar manner.

Choices:
  A: This choice discusses moderation and individual differences; it doesn't use any analogy.
  B: This choice uses analogy, comparing a device that causes cancer in lab animals to chemicals that also may cause cancer in high doses.
  C: This choice deals with the necessity of hiring employees; it doesn't use any analogy.

Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The nicotine study found that no matter the level of nicotine in the cigarettes, smokers who smoke one pack a day have identical blood nicotine levels by the end of the day. 

  Choice B suggests that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more cigarettes, which can explain how they end up with the same blood nicotine levels as those who smoke high-nicotine cigarettes.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The context mentions that the levels of nicotine found in the blood are identical, no matter the level of nicotine in the cigarettes. If smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes tend to smoke more cigarettes per day, this could explain why the nicotine level in their blood is similar to smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The study shows that nicotine levels in the blood of smokers are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes. 
  We need to find an explanation for this finding.

Option A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine - This does not explain the identical levels in both low and high nicotine cigarette smokers.

Option B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes smoke more - This could explain the finding as they end up consuming more cigarettes to get the same level of nicotine.

Option C: Absorption regardless of smaller quantities - This also does not explain the finding, as it wouldn't justify identical levels in both groups of smokers.

Option D: Tar levels higher in low-nicotine cigarettes - This does not explain the nicotine levels in the blood.

Option E: Nicotine level decreases when smoking stops - This does not explain the identical levels in smokers of both low and high nicotine cigarettes.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The study shows that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the nicotine levels in the cigarettes they smoke. We need to find an explanation for this finding.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The finding states that nicotine levels in blood are identical regardless of the nicotine level in cigarettes.
  Choice B explains that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more per day, which adjusts their total nicotine absorption, leading to similar nicotine levels in blood as high-nicotine cigarette smokers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The study is about nicotine levels in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day.
  We need to explain why nicotine levels are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the cigarette nicotine content.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The study found that nicotine levels in the blood are the same in smokers after a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke.
  
  Choice B says that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. This explanation could account for the same nicotine levels in the blood at the end of the day because low-nicotine smokers are compensating for the lower amount of nicotine in each cigarette by smoking more.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The study found that nicotine levels in the blood are the same, regardless of the nicotine content in the cigarettes.
  The fact that plays a role in explaining this finding should consider the quantity or pattern of smoking.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If smokers who smoke low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more cigarettes per day to compensate for the lower nicotine level, it could explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are identical at the end of the day.

Response 9:
Thought: 
  The study finding is that blood nicotine levels are the same at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes.

Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that bread prices increase by 10-15% while grain-fed beef prices almost double when grain prices double. We need to find an explanation for this disparity.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We need to find the choice that explains why bread prices rise 10-15% and beef prices almost double when grain prices double. Since the cost of feeding cattle is mostly grain, it makes sense that the beef prices would closely follow the increase in grain prices. For bread, since there are other costs like labor and marketing, the increase in grain prices would have less of an impact on the overall cost.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question asks about the explanation for the differing impacts of grain prices on bread and beef prices. The focus should be on how grain prices affect their respective production costs.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The question asks for an explanation of why bread prices rise by a smaller percentage than beef prices when grain prices double. The distinction between the costs involved in producing bread and beef will likely explain the difference in price changes.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: We need to find an explanation for the difference in price effect between bread and grain-fed beef. The choice must provide a reason for only a 10 to 15 percent increase in the price of bread and near doubling in the price of grain-fed beef.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If the labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, then the effect of doubled grain prices would be minimal. However, if the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, then the doubled grain prices would heavily impact beef prices.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an explanation as to why the price of bread increases by 10-15% while the price of grain-fed beef nearly doubles when grain prices double.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation for the difference in price change for bread and beef when grain prices double.
  The phenomenon is described as bread prices increase moderately, while beef prices nearly double.

Response 8:
Thought: The question asks for an explanation of why bread prices rise only 10-15% when grain prices double, while beef prices almost double. We need to look for a choice that explains the different reactions of bread and beef prices to an increase in grain prices.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:

Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.

Thought: The argument is about the effectiveness of lichens in monitoring air pollution compared to mechanical devices. For the argument to be strengthened, it should address the ability of lichens to absorb or monitor other significant air pollutants besides copper.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is about using lichens as a cheaper way to monitor air quality due to their absorption of airborne pollutants. Strengthening the argument would involve proving that lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices for multiple pollutants.

However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.

Topic: Law
Context: Mario: I see that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business. Evidently there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. So if you're planning to open a new business there, rugs would be one product to avoid. Renate: It's true that the store is gone, but its closing had little to do with the product it sold. All this means is that the
Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality
  B: it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
  C: it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale
  D: any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale
  E: rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs
Response 0:
Thought:
  Mario suggests avoiding opening a rug store in Glendale based on the assumption of low demand for rugs.
  Renate argues that the rug store's closing had little to do with the product it sold, implying there may still be a market for rugs in Glendale.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Mario suggests that the rug store in Glendale closed due to low demand for rugs. 
  Renate says the store's closing had little to do with the product it sold. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Mario indicates that the rug store's closure suggests little demand for rugs in Glendale.
  Renate mentions that the store's closure had little to do with the product it sold.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Mario suggests that there's little demand for rugs in Glendale, implying that it's not a good idea to open a rug store there.
  Renate says the store's closing was not due to the product, implying that the market for rugs in Glendale cannot be determined from this instance alone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Mario suggests that there's little demand for rugs in Glendale, so opening a rug store would not be a good idea. Renate acknowledges the store's closure but implies that it was not due to the demand for rugs. Therefore, they disagree on whether the demand for rugs affected the store's closure.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Mario thinks the rug store closed due to low demand for rugs in Glendale.
  Renate thinks the closing had little to do with the product it sold (rugs).

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Mario suggests that there is little demand for rugs in Glendale and it would be a bad idea to open a new store.
  Renate argues that the closure of the rug store is not related to the product it sold (rugs).

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that calling H. pylori a commensal is misguided because only a small percentage of people with Mycobacterium tuberculosis get sick from it, yet no one calls it a commensal. The statement that would undermine this argument would challenge the comparison between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

Thought:
  The argument states that calling H. pylori a commensal is misguided based on the comparison to M. tuberculosis. To undermine the argument, we would need to find a significant difference between the two bacteria that would justify treating them differently.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that calling H pylori a commensal is misguided because, like M tuberculosis, it also affects a small percentage of the people who harbor it. So, we need to find a choice that undermines the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is reasoning that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because, like M tuberculosis, it causes illness in a small percentage of people it inhabits. The information that undermines this reasoning would point out a difference between the two bacteria's effects on their human hosts.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that it is misguided to call H pylori a commensal because the same logic isn't applied to M tuberculosis. The statement that would most seriously undermine this argument would be if M tuberculosis brought no benefit to those it is present in, unlike H pylori.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The main argument is that it is incorrect to consider H pylori as a commensal, as that term is designated for bacteria that benefit human beings when they are present in the body. The argument claims that although many scientists consider H pylori a commensal because it strengthens the immune response, it is still responsible for causing stomach ulcers. The argument also references M tuberculosis as an example of a bacterium that affects only a small percentage of people who harbor it but is not considered a commensal.

  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that H pylori can still be considered a commensal even though it causes stomach ulcers.

    Choice A discusses treatments and does not affect the argument.
    
    Choice B compares the duration of illnesses and does not affect the argument.
    
    Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. This statement implies that M tuberculosis is not a commensal. If H pylori benefits people in some way, this distinction supports the idea that it could still be considered a commensal despite causing ulcers.
    
    Choices D and E compare the number of people who harbor each bacterium and do not affect the argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument's reasoning is that just because a small percentage of people get sick from a bacterium, it doesn't mean it's a commensal. The focus is on the presence of a benefit.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument's reasoning is that because only a small percentage of people who harbor each bacterium get sick, neither should be considered commensal. It would be most undermined by a difference in possible benefits from harboring the bacteria.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: The argument's reasoning is that H. pylori should not be considered a commensal because, like M. tuberculosis, only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick. To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a difference between the two bacteria that could justify considering H. pylori a commensal.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that it is misguided to classify H pylori as a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers, and only around 10% of people get sick, whereas M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal despite similar statistics. The key information to undermine the argument would be the difference in benefits derived from each bacterium's presence.

Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears have the ability to navigate over long distances.
  The evidence provided is a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released 500 kilometers away.
  The choice that casts doubt on this evidence should show that the bear used something other than its navigation ability.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  To cast doubt on the naturalists' claim, we need to find evidence that the specific polar bear's return home was not due to its navigation skills.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence provided is a polar bear that returned home after being released 500 km away.
  
  We need to find the choice that casts the MOST doubt on the validity of the evidence.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the evidence of the polar bear being able to navigate should be doubted, a choice should mention a factor not related to the bear's ability to navigate.
  
  Choice B implies that the polar bear was already familiar with the release site due to being on its annual migration route. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The naturalists are claiming that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. The evidence they use is the instance of a polar bear returning to its home territory after being released far away. We need to find the choice that undermines this evidence's validity.

  Option A is irrelevant because stopping and changing course doesn't necessarily undermine the claim.
  Option B casts doubt on the evidence because if the release site is on the bear's annual migration route, it could simply be following an already familiar path, not navigating from unfamiliar territory.
  Option C is not relevant because the type of terrain doesn't directly undermine the claim.
  Option D is also irrelevant because it's unrelated to the specific evidence provided about the polar bear.
  Option E simply suggests one of the ways a polar bear might navigate but does not cast doubt on the evidence.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find the choice which casts most doubt on the validity of evidence supporting polar bears navigating over considerable distances.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
- The naturalists use an example of a polar bear returning to its home territory after being released far away as evidence of navigation ability.
- We need to find a choice that weakens this evidence.

Analyze Choices:
  A: The polar bear changing course doesn't necessarily weaken the evidence, as it might still reach its home.
  B: If the release site was on the bear's annual migration route, it might mean it was familiar with the area, hence weakening the evidence for navigation in unfamiliar territory.
  C: The nature of the route doesn't weaken the evidence of navigation ability.
  D: Other mammals finding their way home doesn't weaken the evidence about polar bears.
  E: Relying on their sense of smell doesn't directly weaken the evidence for navigation ability in unfamiliar territory.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The naturalists claim that polar bears have good navigation skills.
  Relevant information to cast doubt on their claim would show that the returning bear had previous knowledge of the area or any help in this process.
  Choice B indicates that the bear was released on its annual migration route, which means it was already familiar with the area.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The polar bear's navigational ability is in question.
  We need to find evidence that casts doubt on the naturalists' claim.
  If the release site was on the bear's annual migration route, it would undermine the evidence.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over long distances.
  The evidence used is a polar bear returning home after being released far away.
  We need to find a statement that casts doubt on the validity of this evidence.

Answer: In this case, choice "B" casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence, since being released on the annual migration route could potentially mean the bear just followed its regular route home rather than navigating from unfamiliar territory specifically.

Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets

Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The discrepancy is that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but still have the same likelihood to reach maximum life expectancy in both captivity and the wild.
  We need to find an explanation that reconciles this discrepancy.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The discrepancy is that leatherbacks have the same life expectancy in captivity and the wild, even though they are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity that they wouldn't experience in the wild.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: The passage describes leatherbacks having similar likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy regardless of being in captivity or the wild. The answer should help explain this observation.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The discrepancy is that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases, but their life expectancy is still the same as wild leatherbacks. 
  If most wild leatherbacks are killed by predators, this would explain why their life expectancy is about the same despite the diseases in captivity.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The discrepancy is that the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity as in the wild, despite being prone to fatal diseases in captivity.
  If most leatherbacks die in the wild due to predators, it could explain why their life expectancy is similar regardless of captivity or wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The discrepancy is that leatherbacks have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy in captivity or in the wild, despite captivity exposing them to fatal diseases. To resolve the discrepancy, we need information that provides an explanation for this equal likelihood.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: The discrepancy: Leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but they have the same life expectancy whether in the wild or in captivity. We need to find a reason that might explain this.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is that, despite the fact that leatherbacks in captivity are more susceptible to fatal diseases, their likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is similar to those in the wild.
  We need to find a reason that explains why the life expectancy is similar despite the increased risk of disease in captivity.
  
 Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The science journalist's statements provide information about brown dwarfs and stars with different masses in relation to lithium in their atmospheres.
  If a celestial object has no lithium in its atmosphere, it cannot be a brown dwarf (since they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and thus their lithium is not consumed).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The science journalist's statements tell us that:
  - Stars more massive than the Sun have lithium in their atmospheres.
  - Stars less massive than the Sun have no lithium left because it has been consumed in their nuclear furnace.
  - Brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres because they lack a functional nuclear furnace.
  
From this information, we can deduce that if a celestial object has no lithium in its atmosphere, it cannot be a brown dwarf since they still have lithium in their atmospheres.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The science journalist states:
  1. Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars and have lithium in their atmosphere.
  2. Stars with more mass than the Sun have lithium in their atmosphere.
  3. Stars with less mass than the Sun do not have lithium in their atmosphere.

Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, it means that the renters will likely need to rent the game several times or eventually buy it to properly enjoy and complete the game. This could eventually lead to increased sales. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The publisher's prediction is based on the idea that more sales will follow the high rate of rentals. Among the choices, we need to find the one which strengthens this connection between rentals and sales.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: The publisher's prediction is that game sales will soon exceed expectations. The information that helps justify this prediction should be related to an increase in sales or a reason for players to purchase the game after renting it.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The publisher's prediction is that soon, sales of the game will exceed expectations. 
  To justify this prediction, we need a reason why sales will increase in the future.
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, and they have to rent it multiple times in the meantime, they might decide it's more cost-effective to purchase the game once they realize this. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The publisher's prediction is that sales of the game will exceed expectations. We need to find the choice that most helps to justify this prediction. 

Analysis: 
  A: The availability of purchasing options does not necessarily help to justify the prediction about increased sales.
  B: If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, they are more likely to purchase the game after their rental period, which would help justify the prediction of increased sales.
  C: Popularity of the publisher's games does not specifically justify this particular game's prediction.
  D: People not playing the game extensively after completing it has no direct impact on the predicted increase in sales.
  E: Giving the game away after completing it does not directly impact sales predictions.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The situation is that rentals are exceeding expectations and sales of the game meet expectations. Since renters get a rebate if they purchase the game, we need to find the option that strengthens the idea that the rentals will lead to more sales.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, the rental players who decide to purchase the game will add to the sales numbers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction states that rentals are exceeding expectations and that this will lead to sales exceeding expectations too. The rebate offered for renters who purchase the game is an incentive for people who have rented the game to eventually buy it. Among the given choices, we need to find the one that helps justify the prediction.

  Choice B provides the best justification for the prediction. If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, it means they might rent the game a few times before purchasing it with the rebate, making sales likely to exceed expectations eventually.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The publisher's prediction is that the game sales will exceed expectations. To justify the prediction, we need a choice that strengthens the connection between game rentals and increased sales.
  
  A: This does not relate to exceeding expectations.
  B: This can help to justify the prediction, as it implies that players will need to purchase the game after renting it to complete it.
  C: Although popular, it does not have a direct impact on sales exceeding expectations.
  D: This does not relate to sales exceeding expectations.
  E: This does help with sales but does not justify the prediction related to rentals leading to sales.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that sales will exceed expectations due to high rental rates.
  Renters who purchase the game get a rebate.
  Factors about purchasing the game that help to justify this prediction should be considered.

  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  In the original argument, it is assumed that because the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories and program implementation were unsound. This argument has flawed reasoning, as there might be other factors affecting the inflation rate.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is assuming a cause-and-effect relationship when it does not necessarily hold true. In the original argument, the inflation rate increasing is considered evidence that the party's economic theories were flawed.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  In the context, the flawed reasoning lies in assuming that if a certain condition was fulfilled, the result could have been X; but the result was not X, so it implies the failure of the condition.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes that because the expected outcome did not happen, the original premise must be false. We need to find a similar flawed reasoning in the given choices.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is false causality, as it jumps to the conclusion that the party's economic theories are off the mark simply because the inflation rate increased. To find a similar flawed reasoning, we need to find an argument that assumes one event is the direct result of another without proper evidence.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument assumes that because the outcome did not match the expected result, the theory behind it must be wrong.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes one event happening (or not) proves the theory is incorrect, despite various factors that can affect the outcome. This is a causal fallacy.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes only one cause for the effect (inflation rate increase).
  
Comparison:
  A: Assumes stability in the valley's architecture is only due to the lack of invasion, which is a flawed assumption.
  B: Assumes workers not striking is only due to the party not cutting wages, which is a flawed assumption.
  C: Assumes changes in stock price is only due to selling subsidiaries, which is a flawed assumption.
  D: Assumes residents' support is only due to winning the battle, which is a flawed assumption.
  E: Assumes a decrease in ratings is only due to the new equipment's performance, which is a flawed assumption.

Result: 
  All of the answer choices have similarly flawed reasoning as the original argument. However, option E most closely resembles the original argument by assuming changes in one outcome (ratings) are solely due to one factor (equipment).

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes a causal relationship between two events (the party's economic theories being sound and the inflation rate) without considering other possible factors. In other words, it commits the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument assumes that because the expected outcome did not occur (inflation rate lessening), the cause (party's economic theories) must be incorrect.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 61 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Thought:
  The government official states that foreign citizens can serve at most levels as public servants, but not as cabinet secretaries. Also, they point out that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as a cabinet secretary when needed. Since cabinet secretaries should only be citizens, it would be logical to say foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The government official says that cabinet secretaries should be citizens. Then, they mention that cabinet undersecretaries act as cabinet secretaries when they are unavailable. So, the logical completion would be to also restrict foreign citizens from being cabinet undersecretaries.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The government official believes that only citizens should perform certain duties as cabinet secretaries. Since cabinet undersecretaries must stand in for cabinet secretaries when needed, the same citizenship requirement would apply to them according to the official's reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The government official has previously stated that cabinet secretaries should only be citizens and that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable. Based on this, it's logical to conclude that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries, as they would have to perform duties that they shouldn't.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The statement mentions that foreign citizens should not have certain duties and that undersecretaries stand in for secretaries when they are unavailable. Therefore, foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries since they might have to perform those duties.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The statement discusses that foreign citizens cannot serve as cabinet secretaries. 
  It also mentions that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 
  Taking these points into account, it would be logical to conclude that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  A foreign citizen is not eligible to serve as a cabinet secretary.
  A cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Since cabinet secretaries should only be citizens, and undersecretaries may need to stand in for them, it makes sense that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The government official states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants, but not as cabinet secretaries. They also mention that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when needed. Therefore, foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries since they are not allowed to serve as cabinet secretaries.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The government official's statement establishes that foreign citizens should not be appointed to cabinet secretaries because of their unique duties. It also mentions that cabinet undersecretaries are expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries. Therefore, to maintain consistency and avoid appointing those who should not perform cabinet secretary duties, it is logical to restrict foreign citizens from serving as cabinet undersecretaries as well.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that development is necessary for growth and they have the right to govern their resources. Their argument is against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position of regulating wetland development.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is to regulate wetland development to protect wildlife.
  Figorian Development Commission's position is that development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, so they should be allowed to develop.
  The principle that supports the Figorian Development Commission's position should argue against regulation and for allowing development.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: The Figorian Development Commission's position is that they should be allowed to develop wetlands as they have conserved and it is necessary for growth. The choice that supports their position should reject the need for immediate regulations or conservation.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission supports developing wetlands as long as it doesn't affect wildlife and for economic growth. The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to regulate wetland development.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that development is necessary for growth and they should have the right to govern their resources like other countries that have already used their resources for commercial purposes.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission's position argues for the right to govern their own resources and allow development, while the Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to protect wildlife by regulating wetland development.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: The main argument of the Figorian Development Commission is that development is necessary for growth and they have equal rights to use their resources as other nations. They are not convinced that their wetland development will be harmful to wildlife. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to protect wildlife by regulating wetland development, while Figorian Development Commission believes they have the right to develop their own resources as other nations have done.

Response 9:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission's position supports development and believes that it might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. The Figorian Wildlife Commission's position focuses on regulating the development to protect wildlife.

Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The columnist argues that because the bill won't be passed for many years, if at all, due to the influence of a few who would be adversely affected, it shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. This reasoning aligns with choice A, which states that in a well-functioning democracy, a bill benefiting most people and not violating human rights should be passed within a few years.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The columnist argues that the country might not be a well-functioning democracy because a bill that most people favor and that doesn't violate basic human rights still faces difficulties in passing due to influential opposition.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The columnist claims that since the bill won't be passed and influential people oppose it, the country is not a well-functioning democracy. This relates to the idea that, in a well-functioning democracy, if a bill is favored by most people and respects human rights, it should be passed.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The columnist suggests that since the bill has public favor and doesn't violate basic human rights, but won't be passed due to influential opposition, the country may not be a well-functioning democracy.

Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise

Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The biologist argues that having six fingers would be just as useful as having five, so it's a matter of usefulness. If it's shown that our perception of the usefulness of five fingers is based on prejudice and not actual usefulness, it would strengthen the biologist's argument.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument states that if humans had six fingers, they would be just as content. To strengthen this argument, we need to find the statement that supports the idea of any configuration being equally useful and prejudices contributing to perceived usefulness.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument states that if humans had six fingers instead of five, we'd be just as content, and our finger configuration is no more useful than others.
  To strengthen this argument, we'd need to show that our perception of finger usefulness is biased or that different finger configurations aren't significantly different in usefulness.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is about the contentment of humans with variations in finger configurations and that the usefulness or perceived usefulness is due to prejudice.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that the number of fingers on the human hand is not inherently better or worse than other configurations and if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges, we would be content with six fingers.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that having a different number of fingers would be just as useful and humans would be content with it.
  The choice that most strengthens the argument would have to show that the usefulness of the finger configuration is not affected by the number of fingers.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

Thought: 
  The biologist's argument is that if humans descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins, we would be just as content with six fingers because our current finger configuration is no more or less useful than any other configuration.
  Therefore, any statement that bolsters the idea that the usefulness of our current configuration is not significantly different from other possible configurations would strengthen the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that if humans had six fingers instead of five, we would be just as content. To strengthen this argument, we need to show that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers doesn't necessarily make it better than other configurations.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.
  Choices that weaken the argument point to factors that imply the actuaries might not be the embezzlers.
  
  A: Weakens the argument - if actuaries were more closely scrutinized, it might be less likely for them to embezzle.
  B: Weakens the argument - breaches in computer security could mean embezzler is someone outside the company.
  C: Weakens the argument - more accountants than actuaries imply a higher probability of an accountant being the embezzler.
  D: Does not weaken the argument - the fact that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement doesn't impact the likelihood of whether an actuary or an accountant is the embezzler.
  E: Weakens the argument - if it's difficult for actuaries to access the records, it might be less likely for them to embezzle.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: Choices A, B, C, and E all weaken the detective's argument by either suggesting that external parties, accountants, or a lack of access could be responsible for the embezzlement, or by implying that actuaries were closely scrutinized. Choice D, on the other hand, doesn't specifically weaken the detective's argument but comments on the vulnerability of XYZ Corporation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries
- We need to find a choice that does not weaken this argument

Analyzing choices:
  A: More scrutiny on actuaries suggests it would have been harder for them to embezzle => weakens
  B: If outsiders could have committed the crime, the likelihood of the embezzler being an actuary is less => weakens
  C: More accountants than actuaries doesn't affect the likelihood of an actuary being the embezzler => doesn't weaken
  D: Vulnerability to embezzlement doesn't affect the likelihood of the internal position of the embezzler => doesn't weaken
  E: More difficult for actuaries to access records suggests it was less likely for them to be the embezzlers => weakens

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.
  We want to find a statement that DOES NOT weaken this argument.

Choices analysis:
  A: Weakens - closer scrutiny of actuaries' activities might make it more difficult for them to commit embezzlement.
  B: Weakens - the possibility of an outside person having access to records introduces doubt about the need for an internal job.
  C: Weakens - fewer actuaries increases the likelihood that an accountant committed the crime.
  D: Does NOT weaken - an independent report pointing out vulnerability doesn't influence the specific argument about actuaries/accountants.
  E: Weakens - difficult access to financial records for actuaries casts doubt on their likelihood of being the embezzler.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries. To weaken the argument, a choice must strengthen the possibility of the embezzler being an accountant or someone else. The only choice that doesn't weaken the detective's argument is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question asks which choice does NOT weaken the detective's argument.
  The detective's argument is that because of the specialized knowledge needed and the mistakes in ledger entries, the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.

Actions:
  Analyze each choice:
  A: Weakens the argument by stating that actuaries were more closely scrutinized.
  B: Weakens the argument by suggesting that outsiders could access the records.
  C: Does not weaken the argument because it doesn't impact the likelihood of whether the embezzler is an accountant or actuary.
  D: Weakens the argument by suggesting that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement in general.
  E: Weakens the argument by stating that actuaries had less access to financial records compared to accountants.

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The detective's argument assumes that the embezzler is one of the actuaries working for XYZ Corporation.
  Weakening statements include alternative suspects or explanations, contrary evidence, or reasons that question the detective's assumptions.
  Statement A implies that the actuaries were less likely to commit the crime without being noticed.
  Statement B suggests external parties might have had access to financial records.
  Statement C indicates a larger pool of possible suspects among accountants.
  Statement E claims that actuaries had less access to financial records than accountants.
  Statement D does not weaken the detective's argument; it simply highlights the corporation's vulnerability to embezzlement.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries. We need to find the choice that does NOT weaken this argument.

  A: Suggests actuaries were less likely to get away with embezzlement due to supervision - weakens
  B: Suggests that someone outside XYZ Corporation could have embezzled - weakens
  C: Does not make actuaries less likely to be the embezzler - does not weaken
  D: Suggests that someone else could have easily embezzled - weakens
  E: Suggests that actuaries had less access to records, making it less likely - weakens

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Choices A, B, C, and E all weaken the detective's argument by introducing factors that cast doubt on the likelihood of the embezzler being an actuary.
  Choice D does not directly weaken the argument as it only states that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to find the statement that does NOT weaken the detective's argument that the embezzler is an actuary at XYZ Corporation.

  A: This weakens the argument because it suggests that it would be harder for an actuary to commit the crime.
  B: This weakens the argument because it introduces the possibility that the culprit is from outside the company.
  C: This weakens the argument because it suggests that the probability of the embezzler being an accountant is higher due to the number of accountants.
  D: This statement doesn't directly weaken the argument as it doesn't change the likelihood of the embezzler being an actuary or an accountant.
  E: This weakens the argument because it suggests that it would be harder for an actuary to commit the crime.

Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.

Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.

Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits, rather than from living organisms. To weaken this argument, we need to find an explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum that doesn't rely on it coming from living organisms.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits.
  To weaken this argument, we need information that explains the presence of biomarkers in petroleum that formed from deep carbon deposits.

  The geologist's argument states that the presence of biomarkers refutes the theory that petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits, since biomarkers indicate the existence of living organisms.
  
  To weaken the geologist's argument, we should find evidence that suggests that biomarkers can be associated with deep carbon deposits and not just living organisms.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is based on the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, which indicates the involvement of living organisms.
  If something other than living organisms' remains could also lead to the presence of biomarkers in petroleum, the argument would be weakened.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument states that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum refutes the theory that petroleum formed from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth, as biomarkers indicate the existence of a living organism. 

To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for the presence of biomarkers in petroleum (other than from the fossilized remains of plants and animals).
 
Action: Answer("D")

Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that because some people don't develop harmful symptoms due to staphylococcus, they must be immune. The argument confuses correlation with causation.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student's argument flaw is that they assume immunity only because the people exposed to staphylococcus do not develop harmful symptoms.
  
  The most similar flawed pattern of reasoning is:
  E: Assuming the procedure of hand washing has less value in preventing diseases just because doctors wash hands less often than other health care professionals.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student's argument is flawed because it assumes that having no harmful symptoms is equal to immunity. This is not the case, as people may not exhibit symptoms but still not have immunity. We need to find a choice with a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The student's flawed argument is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between immunity, exposure, and harmful symptoms. Let's find a choice with a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.

  A: This involves morally right and just actions. No flawed pattern of reasoning similar to the original argument.
  B: This involves advertisers and writers of fiction, with an incorrect assumption. This has a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
  C: This involves medication and illness, but the flaw is in assuming an either-or scenario, not the same pattern of reasoning.
  D: This involves taxation and business expansion, but the flaw is in correlating two events, not the same pattern of reasoning.
  E: This involves doctors and hand washing, with an incorrect conclusion based on an observation, which is not the same flawed pattern of reasoning.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The student's argument says that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms, they must have immunity. This is a flawed pattern of reasoning because it ignores other factors that could prevent harmful symptoms.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The student's faulty argument is based on the reasoning that if many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms, they must have immunity. This overlooks other possible explanations for the situation.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The student's flawed reasoning is that just because many people don't develop harmful symptoms, they must have immunity to the microorganism.

  Comparison of reasoning:
  A: Compares two separate concepts but does not assume one implies the other.
  B: False assumption that because writers of fiction are not advertisers, they never persuade people about certain claims.
  C: Assumes that because Isabel is still ill, she didn't take the medication.
  D: Assumes that the decline in business expansions is solely because of high taxes.
  E: Assumes that because doctors wash hands less often, the procedure must not be valuable in preventing disease.

Action: Answer("B")

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Thought: The journalist is dismissing the physician's critique because they are employed by the company manufacturing the drug, assuming that they can't provide legitimate grounds due to personal reasons. The most vulnerable point in this argument is that it doesn't consider that the physician might still provide valid grounds despite their personal reasons.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The journalist's argument is based on the assumption that since the physician works for the drug company, their critique is not legitimate.
  The best choice would address the possibility that the critique could still be legitimate despite the physician's connection to the drug company.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The journalist's argument states that the physician's critique of the book doesn't provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims because the physician has a personal reason (being employed by the drug company) to deny the claims.

Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Thought: Since the question is about the evolution process of the human brain, we can eliminate options that don't directly provide a link between the diet and the human brain's evolution in savanna and woodland areas. Options A, B, and E do not directly address this link. Option D talks about the archaeological findings, but it does not help resolve the apparent conflict. Therefore, option C seems most plausible as it explains that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas had more reliable and abundant resources, allowing the human brain to evolve in those areas despite the availability of resources in shore environments.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The conflict is between the need for a high-calorie diet for brain evolution and the fact that this evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments. We need to find a statement that explains why savanna and woodland areas could provide enough resources for the brain's evolution.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The conflict is that a high-calorie diet was needed for early human brain evolution, but the abundance of such foods was in shore environments, while the evolution occurred mainly in savanna and woodland areas. We need to find a reason why savanna and woodland areas could still provide enough resources despite not being as rich as shore environments.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The context states that a high-calorie diet was necessary for brain evolution.
  Shore environments had abundant resources for such a diet.
  However, brain evolution happened in savanna and woodland areas.

To resolve this conflict, we need a reason that explains why early humans would evolve in savanna and woodland areas, given that abundant resources for a high-calorie diet were available at shore environments.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The conflict is that the human brain's evolution required high-calorie diets which were abundant in shore environments, but the evolution mostly took place in savanna and woodland areas.

  The question is asking for the choice that best explains the study's finding that office workers who report the least control over their work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. We must look for a choice that establishes a relationship between the lack of control and the increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The question asks for a factor that helps explain the relationship between less control on the job and higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question asks for an explanation for the study's findings that workers with the least control over their own work have a higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. 

  Choice B suggests that emotional stress from a lack of control increases susceptibility to nerve disorders like carpal tunnel syndrome. This could explain the higher risk of carpal tunnel syndrome for those with less control.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The question asks which choice helps to explain why workers with the least control over their own work are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. Choice B directly addresses the connection between a lack of control over one's own work and susceptibility to nerve disorders. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to find the choice that helps to explain why workers reporting the least control over their own work have a higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

  A: This choice contradicts the context statement about "similar amounts of typing."
  B: This choice connects lack of control, emotional stress, and nerve disorders, which makes it a possible explanation.
  C: This choice is about keyboards' design, not control over work.
  D: This choice discusses workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not the focus of the study.
  E: This choice explains about other repetitive motions, not typing.

Thought:
  The study finds that workers with less control over work have three times the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome as those with more control. We need to find a statement that explains this finding.

  A: Contradicts the study
  B: Connects lack of control to emotional stress, which can make one more susceptible to nerve disorders
  C: This explains the typing problem but doesn't address the control aspect
  D: Describes workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not the focus group
  E: States more control workers do other repetitive motions, but does not relate to carpal tunnel syndrome caused by typing.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The study found that workers with the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome than those with the most control. We need to explain the reason behind this study's findings.

Choices A, C, and E do not address the relationship between control over one's work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Choice D is not relevant, as it discusses workers who rarely use keyboards.

Choice B connects the feeling of lack of control over one's own work to emotional stress, which in turn makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders (such as carpal tunnel syndrome).

Action: Answer("B") 
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation that helps understand the study's findings regarding the relationship between control over work and the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.

Choice A explains a reason for less typing among workers with more control, but it doesn't explain the higher risk for those with less control.
Choice B provides an explanation that links emotional stress due to lack of control to increased susceptibility to nerve disorders like carpal tunnel syndrome. This choice is a strong candidate.
Choice C focuses on the design of keyboards but doesn't address the relationship between control over work and risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Choice D discusses the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome among workers who rarely use keyboards, which is not relevant to the given context.
Choice E compares the frequency of non-typing repetitive motions between workers with different levels of control over their work but doesn't explain the relationship between control and carpal tunnel syndrome risk.

Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The discrepancy is that the drug is considered dangerous despite having no serious side effects and being effective.
  What helps to reconcile the discrepancy would be a reason the drug still poses a risk to the public even with its benefits.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: The discrepancy is that the drug is effective but could be dangerous when widely used.

Choices analysis:
  A: The drug being expensive doesn't address the danger aspect.
  B: Low patient compliance doesn't address the danger aspect.
  C: Not preventing the spread doesn't reconcile the discrepancy.
  D: Misuse is a separate issue, not related to the drug's effectiveness.
  E: This option helps reconcile the discrepancy because even if the drug is effective, its widespread use could lead to drug-resistant and deadlier forms of chicken pox.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The discrepancy is regarding the drug being dangerous, despite it having no serious side effects and being effective.
  To reconcile the apparent discrepancy, we need to find a statement that highlights potential risks associated with widespread use.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is why widespread use of the drug is dangerous if it effectively treats chicken pox and has no serious side effects.
  The key to resolving the discrepancy must show how the widespread use of the drug could create a dangerous situation.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The apparent discrepancy is that the drug is effective and has no serious side effects, but its widespread use could be dangerous. The correct answer should help explain why using the drug could be dangerous despite its effectiveness and lack of side effects.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question aims to find an explanation for the apparent discrepancy—why the effective antidote with no serious side effects could be considered dangerous for widespread use.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The discrepancy is about the drug being effective while its widespread use being dangerous.
  The reason that helps most to reconcile the discrepancy should explain a potential harm that outweighs the benefits when the drug is used widely.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 84 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument pattern involves: An expert predicts an outcome if a specific condition is met. The outcome does not happen, so the condition probably was not met.

  Reviewing the choices:

  A: An expert predicts survival if the surgery is well performed. The patient did not survive, so the surgery was probably not well performed. (similar pattern).
  
  B: An expert predicts a sample without organic compounds. Then the conclusion is related to the label. (different pattern)
  
  C: An expert predicts damage not noticeable if proper repair. The damage is noticeable, so the repair probably was not proper. (similar pattern)
  
  D: An expert predicts roof repair needed only if storm. Roof is leaking without a storm, so the expert is probably wrong. (different pattern)
  
  E: An expert predicts lead finding in the soil if tests are properly conducted. Lead is found, so tests were probably properly conducted. (opposite pattern)

  Choices A and C have similar patterns, but choice C is slightly closer to the original argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that if a condition is not met (poorly promoted), then a certain outcome will occur (not selling out). The event indeed does not have the desired outcome (selling out), and therefore we conclude that the condition (poor promotion) is probably true.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states "if not properly promoted -> not sell out" and "concert not sold out -> it was not properly promoted."
  We should look for a similar pattern of reasoning in the given choices.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
- Wells said the concert would sell out unless poorly promoted.
- The concert did not sell out.

Similar pattern of reasoning:
- Someone knowledgeable said X would happen unless Y.
- X did not happen.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The pattern of reasoning in the argument is as follows: an expert expects a certain outcome if a condition is met; the desired outcome does not occur, so the condition likely was not met.

  Comparing this pattern with the choices:

  A: Expert expectation, undesired outcome, likely unmet condition - matches the pattern
  B: Expert expectation, but the reasoning is not about an undesired outcome and unmet condition
  C: Expert expectation, undesired outcome, likely unmet condition - matches the pattern
  D: Expert expectation, undesired outcome, but the reasoning is about the expert being wrong rather than the condition
  E: Expert expectation, desired outcome, met condition - opposite pattern

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  In the original argument:
  - Wells is knowledgeable about the concert business.
  - Wells said it would sell out unless poorly promoted.
  - The concert did not sell out.
  - Conclusion: The concert was probably poorly promoted.
  
  The choice with a similar pattern of reasoning is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The pattern in the original argument is about an expected outcome not happening because a necessary condition was not met.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The original argument is structured as follows: 
  Expert states X will happen unless Y. X did not happen. Thus, Y must be true.
  Let's find the answer that follows the same pattern.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
 The argument is based on a situation where an expected outcome does not occur, and it is likely due to a certain condition not being met.
 
 We need to find a similar pattern of reasoning in the choices.

Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior for Kodiak bears based on their hip and foot bones structure. It doesn't consider the possibility of a combination of innate capacity and learning.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument focuses on the shape of the bones as an explanation for the bears' natural ability to walk upright. The argument seems to rule out the possibility of a mix of innate capacity and learning, without considering the fact that some behaviors can be simultaneously innate and learned.

Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts.
Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts.
  B: Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians.
  C: Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
  D: Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts.
  E: All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Survey results: Most physicians believe their choices are not influenced by gifts, but most other physicians' choices are.

Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because of its neck structure. This conclusion assumes that there was no other way for the dinosaur to access high-growing vegetation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus's neck structure would have prevented it from browsing high-growing vegetation, and that instead, it could bend downward and extend below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required is that there was no other way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that since the neck bones of Diplodocus prevented it from raising its neck to browse high-growing vegetation, the dinosaur must have fed on plants on or near the ground or underwater. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater due to its neck bone structure.
  The assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had no other way to access high-growing vegetation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument focuses on the neck structure of Diplodocus and how it would have affected its feeding habits. The fact that it could not raise its neck to access high-growing vegetation leads to the conclusion that it must have fed on ground or underwater plants. Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because its neck structure prevented it from reaching high-growing vegetation. An assumption required by this argument must be something that supports this conclusion. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: The argument states that since Diplodocus's neck was not capable of reaching high-growing vegetation, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. The assumption made is that there was no other way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater, because its neck structure prevented it from reaching high-growing vegetation. The assumption is that there isn't any other way for Diplodocus to access high-growing vegetation.

Topic: Law
Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously serves as a premise that leads to the main conclusion, which is that human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction and that this important social function can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The main point of the psychologist's argument is that human psychology is primarily driven by personal interaction, and expressing gratitude plays an important social role in reinforcing positive behaviors. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously supports the main argument indirectly.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is connected to the role of personal interaction in human psychology and the importance of positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors. This claim helps to establish the importance of non-anonymous gratitude for social function. Therefore, it is used to support a claim that leads to the conclusion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The psychologist argues that positive reinforcement relies on personal interaction. The claim "obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously" is used to explain how gratitude must be personally identifiable. The claim supports the idea that personal interaction drives human psychology, which in turn supports the conclusion about the importance of personal interaction in positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors. Therefore the claim is indirectly supporting the conclusion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: The psychologist's argument uses the claim as a support to the conclusion. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously serves as a partial premise contributing to the importance of personal interaction when expressing gratitude.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used to emphasize the importance of personal interaction in fulfilling this obligation, and ultimately helps support the conclusion that human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The psychologist's claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is a premise leading to the conclusion that human psychology is driven by personal interaction, fulfilling the purpose of positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors. Thus, it indirectly supports the conclusion that personal interaction is essential.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: The psychologist is arguing that personal interaction is necessary for reinforcing beneficial behaviors. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used to support this argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The psychologist's argument focuses on the importance of personal interaction in expressing gratitude. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used as a premise to support the argument's conclusion. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The psychologist's argument revolves around the role of expressing gratitude in human psychology and social interactions.
  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously serves as evidence to reinforce the argument's main conclusion - that humans should positively reinforce beneficial behaviors through personal interaction.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that regular powder detergent does not dissolve well in front-loading washers and, to get clothes really clean, you need a detergent specially formulated for front-loading washers.

Assumption:
  A detergent must dissolve properly in water to clean clothes effectively.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument focuses on the need for a detergent formulated for front-loading washers and the dissolving issues with ordinary powder detergent in front-loading washers.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  The argument assumes that the detergent needs to dissolve readily for clothes to get really clean.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers and that a special detergent is needed. This means that getting clothes really clean in a washer requires detergent that dissolves readily in that particular washer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In the context, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a specific detergent is needed because ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve easily.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent specifically formulated for front-loading washers should be used. The reason given is that front-loading washers use less water, which causes regular powder detergent to not dissolve as easily. So, the assumption required by the argument is that for clothes to be really clean, the detergent must dissolve readily in the washer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is suggesting that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve easily in front-loading washers and thus a specially formulated detergent is required for proper cleaning. The assumption would be that a detergent needs to dissolve readily in order to effectively clean clothes in a washer.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, one must use detergent formulated for front-loading washers. This is due to the fact that front-loading washers use less water, and ordinary powder detergent doesn't dissolve readily in them.
  The assumption behind this statement would be that if a detergent doesn't dissolve properly, it won't clean clothes effectively.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument states that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, it needs to use a detergent specially formulated for front-loading washers and not ordinary powder detergent. This implies that dissolving the detergent is essential for the machine to get clothes clean.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The magazine's argument states that ordinary powder detergent doesn't dissolve well in front-loading washers, so using a special detergent for front-loading washers will get clothes really clean. The assumption here is that a detergent must dissolve readily in a washer to get clothes really clean.

Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.

Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature, and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. This means that it is not true for all descriptions of monstrous beasts, just some of them. Choice E connects these two types and their shared feature: symbolism and violations of the laws of nature.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Given that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader, we can narrow down our answer choices.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  From the context, we have the following information:
  - both kinds of horror stories: (1) describe violations of the laws of nature, and (2) are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  - in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
  - horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.

Looking at the options, choice E aligns with the information provided, as some horror stories about monstrous beast use symbolism and describe violations of the laws of nature.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
According to the passage, both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. So, if a horror story with a monstrous beast symbolizes a psychological disturbance, it still describes a violation of the laws of nature. Thus, some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that both kinds of horror stories (1. mad scientists' experiments, 2. monstrous beasts) describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.

Statement A: It is given that some horror stories about monstrous beasts describe the monster as a psychological disturbance in the protagonist and not necessarily always as a violation of the laws of nature.

Statement B: This would be true because both kinds of horror stories are mentioned to describe violations of the laws of nature and intend to invoke dread in the reader.

Statement C: Not all types of horror stories necessarily describe characters who are psychologically disturbed. It is only partially mentioned about horror stories related to monstrous beasts where the monster can symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but not all.

Statement D: Stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone isn't enough, but it doesn't mean the author has antiscientific views.

Statement E: Symbolism is mentioned in some monstrous beast horror stories, and both kinds of horror stories describe violations of laws of nature. So, some stories employing symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text states that both kinds of horror stories share two characteristics. They describe violations of the laws of nature, and they aim to invoke dread in the reader. Given this, a choice that would also have to be true would be one that connects these two shared aspects.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that both kinds of horror stories (monstrous beasts and mad scientists) describe violations of the laws of nature and are meant to invoke dread in the reader. It also says that in some horror stories, monstrous beasts represent a psychological disturbance.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The statements mention that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. This implies that there could be stories that use symbolism and describe violations of the laws of nature.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text mentions that both kinds of horror stories (monstrous beasts and mad scientists) share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. Option E states that some stories that employ symbolism (referring to the monstrous beasts horror stories that symbolize a psychological disturbance) describe violations of the laws of nature. This statement must be true based on the given information.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage states that both kinds of horror stories (monstrous beasts and mad scientists) share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.

  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries. We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries since both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries. To weaken this argument, we have to show that there is a difference in their injuries, or that stretching could have an impact on preventing injuries.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries. To weaken this argument, we should find a choice that establishes a reason for the lack of difference in injury rates between the two groups of joggers or one that shows the benefits of stretching in preventing injuries.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging doesn't help prevent injuries. To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer choice that explains why the evidence presented might not support the conclusion.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. We need to find the choice that weakens this argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging doesn't help prevent injuries based on the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who don't.
  We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.

  Choice A: It does not state any causal relationship between stretching and injury rates.
  Choice B: Difficulty in stretching doesn't directly relate to the effectiveness of stretching in preventing injuries.
  Choice C: If most jogging injuries are unrelated to flexibility, then stretching may not have a significant impact on injury prevention.
  Choice D: If more injury-prone joggers are stretching before jogging, that could make the injury rate seem similar even if stretching actually helps.
  Choice E: This talks about certain forms of exercise but not specifically jogging.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries. We need to find an option that weakens this argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: The argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. To weaken this argument, we need information that shows stretching has an effect on injury prevention or that the comparison between the two groups of joggers is not accurate.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that either shows that stretching helps prevent injuries, or that the comparison made by the scientists is somehow flawed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. To weaken this argument, we should find a choice that shows that stretching could potentially help in some way.

### Model: gpt-4 | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The original argument assumes that because most sociology majors are taking the class and most psychology majors are not, there must be more sociology majors in the class. It ignores the possibility of other factors affecting enrollment.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The original argument's flawed reasoning is that it draws a conclusion about the total number of majors in the class based on the proportion of majors from each group.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that, just because a majority of students from one major are enrolled in the class, it doesn't mean that there are more students from that major than another major in the class. The answer choice should have a similar flawed reasoning pattern.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument is that the number of students from one major taking a specific class is not a basis for determining the number of enrolled students in that class belonging to another major.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: In the original argument, the flawed reasoning is assuming that a majority of one group participating in an activity translates to having more members than another group participating in the same activity.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The flawed reasoning in the original argument compares two different groups (sociology majors and psychology majors) taking a certain class, and then jumps to the conclusion that there must be more of one group than the other in the class.
  
  Similar flawed reasoning occurs in choice E: the argument compares two different types of properties (houses and condominiums) on the website, and then jumps to the conclusion that there must be more of one type than the other for sale.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The original argument is flawed because it assumes there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the most students fact, without considering other factors.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the first argument is drawing a conclusion based on the majority of one group without considering the total number of people or items in each group.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The original argument incorrectly assumes that a higher proportion of one group taking a class must mean the group has a greater number of students than the other group. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The flawed reasoning in the original statement is that it assumes that just because something is true for the majority of one group, it also implies that it would be true for a comparison between different groups.

Action: Answer("E")

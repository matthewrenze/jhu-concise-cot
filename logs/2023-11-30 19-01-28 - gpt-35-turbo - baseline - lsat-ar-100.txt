Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. This means K cannot be published in the spring. From the given constraints, we know that if K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. So, if M is published in the fall, then the only other cookbook that can be published in the fall with M is O. Hence, the answer is:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
From the given conditions, if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M, so eliminate answer choices (A) and (D).
If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, answer choice (E) cannot be correct because O and P cannot both be published in the fall.
This leaves us with answer choices (B) and (C). Let's check both.
If L and N are published in the fall with M, we satisfy all given conditions. So, Action: Answer("B") is the correct answer.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
The pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M, if M is published in the fall, is K and O. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
If M is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall; N must be published in the spring as K and N must be published in the same season. So, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A") K and 0.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
If M is published in the fall, then it follows that N must be published in the spring. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
If M is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall. So, the correct answer is a pair containing K and/or O as one of the cookbooks. The only such pair is (K, O). So,

Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.

Response 4:
Actions:
- Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
- By trading two of Trustcorp’s class 2 buildings for four class 3 buildings, Trustcorp can trade with Southco to get two class 3 buildings for one class 2 building.
- After the trade between Trustcorp and Southco, Trustcorp will own only one class 2 building, and that building cannot be traded for any other building. Therefore, Trustcorp must own the King Building (which is class 2) after some number of trades.
- Since Trustcorp must still own exactly one class 2 building, it cannot have made a trade with RealProp, which only owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
- Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp. Answer: Answer(C)

  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

One recommendation is to make sure your expectations are age-appropriate. The next sentence states that there are developmental milestones which can guide your expectations. 
This suggests that before setting expectations during public outings, parents should learn about these developmental milestones. 
Thus, Option C is the most suitable answer.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text is about setting expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The step expects a parent to consider their child's age and milestones before setting expectations.
  The next sentence is likely to provide more information and guidance on the topic.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")  
Thought: 
  The paragraph discusses the importance of setting age-appropriate expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The paragraph suggests determining developmental milestones as a guideline for children's behavior, but also acknowledges that every child develops at their own pace.
  The most likely completion is to encourage parents to do research, be mindful of the age of their child, and evaluate whether their expectations are realistic before heading out. 
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 
Thought: 
  The text discusses the need to set expectations that are appropriate for a child's developmental milestones.
  The sentence then suggests doing research to learn about these milestones and consider whether your expectations are realistic.
  Choice C discusses researching developmental milestones as a means to ensure that your expectations for your child's behavior in public are age-appropriate.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The current step explains that children develop at their own pace and there are milestones that can guide parental expectations. 
  The most likely completion is a tip or substep that expands upon this idea. 
  Choice A seems to give advice on how to establish expectations rather than how to take into account a child's pace of development.
  Choice B focuses on specific examples instead of providing general advice.
  Choice D seems to be a tangent and not directly related to the topic.
  Choice C sounds plausible because it explains the need to research developmental milestones to set realistic expectations for child behavior.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The paragraph provides advice on how to set expectations for children's behavior in public places. 
  The following step is "Children develop at their own pace". 
  Based on this, it seems like the next sentence will be about how to set expectations for children given that they develop at their own pace. 
  Option B seems to provide advice that is in line with this. 
  Option C may be useful but offers advice on something that is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. Option D does provide information, but it does not address how to set expectations for children's behavior in public, as the paragraph suggests it will.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The completion of the text will likely give a recommendation that is related to setting expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The action that can be taken in order to set age-appropriate expectations for children's behavior in public would be recommended.

  A campfire's flames dance and people watch it, but this text seems to describe the fire once it's already burning.
  "slowly grows" could be a possibility since the campfire is already lit.
  "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" doesn't fit the context as it describes how to light and put out a campfire, not what is most likely to complete the text.
  "rapidly spreads" is not what typically happens to a controlled campfire.

  The most likely completion could either describe another goal being scored or the end of the game with a final goal being scored and a different type of celebration happening.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text describes a goal scored by the yellow team and a celebratory response.
  There are no indications of a loss, and the yellow uniformed team members do not seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.

  Option B suggests that the yellow team scores one more goal, and indicates that the yellow team members are hugging each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: The yellow team scores another goal and celebrates briefly. We need to determine what they do after this.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes that the yellow team earns another goal and celebrates in a brief and physical manner with one another.
  The most likely completion must describe an event that happens after the yellow team scores another goal and celebrates.
  Option A and D are unlikely because they do not align with the celebratory response and a proper conclusion to the text.

  A substep is added that provides examples of protein-rich foods to consume.
  Choice A is incorrect because it doesn't provide a complete sentence with a relevant explanation for hair growth.
  Choice B is incorrect because it is confusing and possibly counterproductive, suggesting protein can make hair thinner. 
  Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't offer any relevant information about hair growth.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
Thought:
  Keratin is the protein that primarily makes up the hair and nails.
  The three phases of hair growth are anagen, catagen, and telogen.
  Hair that is lacking in protein tends to enter the resting stage faster than hair that is rich in protein, making it crucial to include adequate protein in your diet.
  The substeps mentioned in choice C inform us of good sources of protein like chicken, eggs and Greek yogurt.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")  
Thought process:
The text shares that hair and nails are made of keratin, which is a protein. The initial sentence advises its readers to consume more protein so using that knowledge, we can eliminate A, B and D immediately. When looking at C, its substeps explain how protein deprivation can affect hair growth and which foods can be eaten to compensate for that.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

Thought: 
  The title is "Include protein in your daily diet," and the text elaborates on the importance of protein for hair growth. It mentions that hair is made up of a protein called keratin and that hair growth has three phases. 
  Choice A makes a claim that has not been mentioned in the text. 
  Choice B is incorrect as it says that protein can make hair thinner, which goes against the goal of growing hair faster. 
  Choice C discusses the impact of lacking protein on hair growth and recommends some protein-rich foods to consume for optimal hair growth.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  

Thought:
The text discusses how protein affects hair growth, with specific mention of keratin protein. The substeps also mention some specific foods high in protein that can be included in the diet.  
Choice A is misleading since hair quality is not entirely tied to protein, and the percentage values are vague. 
Choice B suggests protein as a source of thinning hair, which is not accurate. 
Choice D is nonsensical and unrelated.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text suggests a relationship between protein and hair growth.
  The text mentions that hair growth has three phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen.
  One of the choices explains how protein consumption relates to hair growth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The text suggests a way to make hair grow faster.
  The following step suggests that hair and nails are made of protein and have three growth phases - anagen, catagen, and telogen.
  The likely completion should suggest how to increase protein consumption to promote hair growth.

  B: drops it down and just sits there relaxing.
  C: slams it against the wall again but it's not so hard this time.
  D: almost drops the weight and sits back up.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The description seems to be describing the clean portion of the clean and jerk lift.
  The man has bent over and grabbed a weight.
  He squats and lifts the weight up.
  It is likely he will now perform the jerk portion of the lift where he will lift the weight over his head.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A") 

Explanation: 
The description fits the beginning of a clean and jerk - Olympic weightlifting movement. The lifter first performs a clean, which involves squatting down, picking up the weight, and standing up while holding the weight at shoulder height. Then, the lifter performs a jerk, which involves lifting the weight above their head by using a quick, explosive movement of the legs. The description indicates that the lifter completed the lift successfully, which implies that they lifted the weight above their head. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the lifter "lifts up above his head and jumps his feet apart."
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A") 

Thought: 
  The man is performing the first part of the Clean and Jerk, where the weight is lifted above his head.
  Choice A mentions lifting the weight above his head so it is the most likely completion of the text.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")  

Thought:
The action described seems to be the 'clean and jerk' weightlifting move which involves lifting the weight from the ground to shoulder and then overhead while jumping feet apart. Thus, the most likely completion to the text is "lifts up above his head and jumps his feet apart."
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
Thought:
The description of the man holding a weight and then lifting it up above his head indicates a clean and jerk.
The option that describes this action is A: lifts up above his head and jumps his feet apart.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A") 

Thought:
  The behavior described is that of a "Clean and Jerk" Weightlifting technique.
  The "Clean" involves picking up a weight from the ground and bringing it from the shoulders to the front rack position.
  The "Jerk" involves bringing the weight to an overhead position.
  The choice that best describes this technique is "lifts up above his head and jumps his feet apart."
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")  
Thought:
  The text describes the man picking up the weight from the ground.
  The man then lifts the weight above his head.
  The movement described is characteristic of the Clean and Jerk weightlifting exercise.
  Option A describes the correct execution of the Clean and Jerk, where the athlete lifts the weight above his/her head and jumps the feet apart.
  Option B, C, and D do not describe what typically happens in the Clean and Jerk exercise.
Response 8:
Thought:
This text describes the first part of the clean and jerk exercise.
The lifter first bends over grabbing onto the weight before lifting it off the ground.
Action: Answer("A") 
The most reasonable completion for this text is that the lifter "lifts up above his head and jumps his feet apart", which is the second part of the clean and jerk exercise where the lifter jerks the weight above their head while jumping their feet apart.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A")  
Thought: 
The description of the man lifting the weight above his head and jumping his feet apart most likely refers to the clean and jerk weightlifting movement, which is a combination of two movements: first, the lifter lifts the barbell from the ground to shoulder-level; then, they use their legs to help push the weight over their head, before finally separating their feet into a stable position for the lift to be counted. Choice A accurately describes this movement.

Thought: 
  The options are all actions that the woman on the back of the camel might do.
  There are no details to suggest that the woman on the back of the camel might be in trouble or need help.
  Looking at her phone seems to be a likely possibility.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:
  The incomplete sentence only mentions the women sitting on a small camel. 
  Option B is the most likely completion because it describes the position of the two women on the camel.
Response 2:
Thought: The text mentions two women sitting on a small camel. There is no indication that the camel is moving, so the answer choice must reflect something that the women are doing while stationary on the camel. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
  Since we know that there are two women sitting on the camel (one in front and one at the back), we can assume that the sentence is about the woman at the back of the camel. Looking at the choices, the only one that completes the sentence and makes sense is that "she starts knee to knee with the woman on the front". Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 4:
Thought:
  As the two women are sitting on the small camel, the most likely completion is something that suggests an action taken by the woman on the back of the camel.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: There are two women riding on a small camel. One of them is sitting on the back. We don't have much context to deduce what is happening. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  It is unlikely for someone to be running and walking alongside a small camel.
  It is also unlikely for someone to be holding a camel down while riding it.
  There is no information in the text about a camera.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text indicates that there are two women sitting on a small camel.
  The subsequent sentence starts with "the woman on the back of the camel," implying that there is a difference in location between the two women.
  Based on the choices, the most likely completion would describe the action taking place with the woman on the back of the camel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  It is not very likely that the women holding the camel down would be looking at their phones or running.
  The camel is small so the two women would be very close in proximity.
  The text mentions nothing about other people.

[header] How to get oil out of hair [title] Shampoo your hair several times. [step] Use your regular shampoo to wash your hair in the shower. Really work the shampoo into your scalp using your fingers and rinse it out thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Choices:
  A: Rinse your hair as soon as possible after it is done, as prolonged washing can hurt the scalp. [title] Dry your hair as soon as possible.
  B: Have a good conditioner available on hand for long-term use. [substeps] Because oil can build up if you're not getting it regular, don't rinse it out very often, as this may clog or unbalance the hair follicles.
  C: Repeat the process one or two more times, as needed. [substeps] After you finish shampooing, add some conditioner to your hair and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsing out.
  D: [substeps] You can use a hairdryer, a microfiber cloth, or a shower cap to gently detangle your hair to avoid spreading the oil or holding your hair in. [title] Squeeze a dime-sized amount of shampoo from a bottle.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The text provides tips for getting oil out of hair.
  The first step is to shampoo your hair several times.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  None of the other choices seem to provide a logical continuation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The sentence seems to be describing a scenario of a player from the blue team trying to hit the goal.
  The first option mentions the blue team coming out of their seats, which seems like a positive outcome.
  The second and fourth options appear to be negative outcomes.
  The third option describes the player trying to keep the ball away from the opponent team, which is not directly related to hitting the goal.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The blue team player aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick, so he is most likely trying to score a goal.
  The choices A and D don't seem like likely completions to the text.
  The choice B indicates the player misses the goal, but the text says he "tries" to hit a goal.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  
Thought: Based on the description, the player is aggressively chasing the ball and trying to hit the goal. Therefore, it is most likely that the player's team member is also trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.

Therefore, it is most likely that he is trying to keep the ball away from an opponent team player who is attempting to prevent him from making the goal. 
  Choices A and D are not supported by the context of the text.
  Choice B suggests that the blue team player loses control of the ball and misses the goal, however, there is no reference to a spin move or an effort to evade the ball, thus it does not accurately depict the scenario described in the text.

  D: wandering around in the street around him walking around.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: The sentence states that behind the marching band, "kids walking in circles are doing a choreography". The most fitting answer to what they are doing while the band is performing is "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them".
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The description suggests the activity is a drum corps performance.
  Typically, the kids behind the drummers in a drum corps are the color guard.
  The answer should describe the activity of the color guard.

Thought:
  The text describes a marching band on the street playing drums and doing a choreography. Behind the band, kids are doing a choreography while walking in circles. The text doesn't indicate that the kids are participating in the performance with the marching band. They are likely just spectators watching the band play. 
  Therefore, the most appropriate completion for the text is "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them," which implies that they are watching the performance.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")  

Thought: The sentence mentions that kids are walking in circles behind the marching band, but it does not mention any other activities that they might be doing. Therefore, the most likely completion is that the kids are sitting on the sidewalk watching the band.
Response 4:
Thought: The description indicates that a marching band is in the street playing the drums while kids are doing a choreography behind them. 
Action: Answer("B") since it is the only option that describes a group of kids appearing to walk down to a stage holding handstands on the stairs and just standing around.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
  The text tells us that a marching band wearing red uniforms are playing drums and doing choreography on the street. Behind the band, kids are walking in circles and doing a choreography. The most likely completion that follows this statement is the option C where the kids are sitting on the sidewalk looking at the band. None of the other options provides information about what the kids are doing, so C is the correct choice.

  The question asks us to choose the most likely completion to the given text.
  The text states that "We see a lady holding a dart and talking. We see shots of a man in a different room. The lady throws darts a a bulletin board. we" 
  Nothing in the given text suggests any of the options provided except an additional mention of what the text shows us.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question describes two scenes: a lady throwing darts at a bulletin board, and a man in a different room.
  There is no mention of a mop, bucket, chair, people taking their darts or another man, or a man punching a hole in a wall.
  The text seems to be incomplete.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The lady is throwing darts, and there is footage of a man in a different room. 
  The options A, B, and C do not connect logically to what has been described.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  We are given information about a lady throwing darts and shots of a man in a different room.
  The lady is throwing darts at a bulletin board.
  There is no indication that we will see a mop and bucket laying on a chair or a man punching a hole in a wall.
  There is also no indication that we will see a title screen or the people taking their darts.

Response 4:
Thought:
  The question is asking about the most likely completion of a brief text.
  The text describes a lady throwing darts at a bulletin board while a man is shown in a different room.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The question is asking what is the most likely completion to the sentence, or what is the next thing we see.
  The lady throws darts at a bulletin board, and then we see shots of a man in a different room - these two things seem to be connected.
  We can rule out "mop and bucket laying on a chair" because there is no mention of cleaning in the prompt.
  We can rule out "a man punching a hole in a wall" because it doesn't seem to fit with the context.
  We can rule out "title screen" because it is not a logical next step after seeing the lady throwing darts.
  That leaves us with "people taking their darts and see another man."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")  
Thought: 
  The most likely response is to see the people take their darts and see another man because it follows chronological order and the action of the lady throwing darts is finished.

  The lady throws darts at a bulletin board and then it looks like there is a transition to another scene.
  There are no clues to suggest any plausible completions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")  
Thought: 
  None of the choices provide a context to the situation.
  However, the most likely completion appears to be that the man gets angry and punches a hole in a wall as a result of the loud noise of darts hitting the bulletin board.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The man is in a different room, and we only see him. There is no mention of any of the other choices.
  The lady throws darts at a bulletin board. It is hard to predict the next sentence that completes the text.

[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.

Response 1:
Thought:
  The question is asking what is most likely to happen after the bacon is put into the pan.
  Option A doesn't mention bread and contradicts the use of an egg pan to add cheese.

  The text talks about how to thin hair using thinning shears.
  The first step in the text already mentions that we need to purchase a pair of thinning shears.
  The next step should be a continuation of this process.
  Choice A talks about using regular scissors and Choice C talks about extra-long (thicker) shears for growing hair.
  Choice D talks about using multiple pairs of thinning shears which is irrelevant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The instructions suggest purchasing a pair of thinning shears to thin hair.
  The next step might be instructions for where to buy the shears.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation:
 The sentence "Thinning shears can be purchased at most hardware stores." does not directly follow the previous sentence that mentions purchasing a pair of thinning shears.
 Choice A is unrelated because it talks about clipping hair at the roots.
 Choice C is unrelated and talks about growing stubble.
 Choice D is incorrect because it talks about using multiple thinning shears on different segments of hair. 
 Therefore, the most likely completion is option B, which provides information on where to find the thinning shears and how to begin working with hair.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text provides a step on how to thin hair which is to purchase a pair of thinning shears.
  Therefore, we need to select the option that provides additional information related to this step such as where to buy them or how to use them.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:

Response 1:
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation: 
  The text doesn't imply any connection between the woman's appearance and flashing words appearing on the screen. 
  Hence, the flashing words are most likely to appear after the woman's talking and continue until the end.
Response 2:

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

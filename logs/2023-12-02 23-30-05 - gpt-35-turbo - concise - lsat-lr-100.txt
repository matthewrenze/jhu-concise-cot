Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The study divides volunteers into five smaller groups.
  The study concludes that the larger group of volunteers prefers Sparkle Cola to any of the competing colas tasted.
  The reasoning is vulnerable to criticism
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.
  The blindfolded volunteers tasted Sparkle Cola and only one competing cola.
  The study does not take into consideration factors that may influence consumer preferences like price, packaging, or other products that were not tested.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The advertisement used blindfolded volunteers to taste test Sparkle Cola and competing colas.
  Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The advertisement is using a carefully controlled study to argue that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning may be vulnerable to criticism if any of the other colas tested would have elicited even fewer positive responses than Sparkle Cola.
  Any of the choices could be the correct answer, let's evaluate each choice:
    A: This is plausible. The study divided volunteers into five smaller groups and it is possible that one of the groups may not agree with the generalization.
    B: This is out of scope. Cost or scenarios where Sparkle Cola is more expensive is not mentioned in the advertisement.
    C: This is plausible. There could be other colas that would elicit a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
    D: This is plausible. The advertisement assumes that Sparkle Cola elicits the most favorable response from consumers based on the taste alone and overlooks other factors.
    E: This is out of scope. The advertisement is not claiming that Sparkle Cola is the only choice, only that it elicits more favorable consumer response than any of the competing colas tested.
  Choice C is the strongest criticism and is the most vulnerable, so the Answer is ("C").
Response 4:
Thought:
  The advertisement is trying to prove that Sparkle Cola is better than other colas.
  The study divided the volunteers into five groups; each group tasted one cola alongside Sparkle Cola.
  Most of the volunteers preferred the taste of Sparkle Cola.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The experiment only tested blindfolded volunteers and not consumers in general.
  The advertisement only tested Sparkle Cola against five competing cola brands.
  There could be a hidden factor such as price or packaging that could have influenced the study's results.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The advertisement conducted a blind study where group members tasted one of the five cola choices and Sparkle Cola. 
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteer preferred Sparkle Cola over the other choices, thereby showing the favorable response of consumers.
  What if the preferred taste of the consumers did not lie among the five colas on the test, but could be different for other colas?
  The advertisement also seems to make false assumptions about the reason for people's preference for Sparkle Cola.
Action: Answer("C") The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers and only tested five competing colas.
  The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response than any of the competing colas tested.
  There might be other colas with better taste than any of the five colas tested in the study.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the other competing colas that they tasted.
  However, there may be favorable factors about Sparkle Cola that the advertisement overlooks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to other colas tasted, but not all volunteers.
  Perhaps other brands or types of beverage would have changed their preferences. 
Action: Answer("C")

Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument has the following pattern of reasoning: if A, then B. But if not C, then A is not true.  
  Answer choices A, B, and D share this pattern. 
  Choice C discusses how to remedy a problem. 
  Choice E has a different pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: The argument above concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. However, the argument does not account for other factors that may affect bird attraction. 
  Based on this, the pattern of flawed reasoning resembles that in option E, which the argument concludes that keeping the tire pressure from becoming too low will not help a tire last longer, ignoring other factors that may also affect tire life-span. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument says that squirrels eating from a bird feeder leads to the feeder not attracting many birds because the feeder is uncovered. 
  Therefore, the argument concludes that bird feeders without protective covers will not attract many birds.
  This is flawed because it assumes that all squirrel activity leads to the same result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument draws a conclusion about the effectiveness of a bird feeder from the presence or absence of a protective cover.
  The conclusion seems to presume that a feeder without a protective cover cannot attract birds.
  There is no reason given to support this claim.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a causal claim.
  The argument is flawed because it presents a false cause.
  The argument claims that squirrels are the cause of lack of birds, but that may not be true.
  The same pattern of reasoning is presented in one of the choices.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument uses a conditional statement in a cause and effect pattern.
  The conclusion is based on the inverse of the necessary condition.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument provides a cause-effect relationship that may not be accurate.
  It implies that the issue of squirrels eating from a bird feeder is directly affecting the number of birds in the area.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder without a protective cover will not attract many birds because squirrels eat from it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may affect the number of birds a feeder attracts.
  We need to find an argument that uses the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it lacks a protective cover due to the fact that squirrels will eat from it, but this doesn't necessarily mean bird feeders with a protective cover aren't also unattractive to birds.
  Option B is flawed in a similar way because it concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, despite other possible causes.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover based only on the premise that squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover.
  The flaw is that the argument does not consider other factors that could contribute to the lack of attraction of birds to a feeder.
  Choice (A) is not similar because it correctly links two facts to reach a conclusion while the original argument has a flaw in linking the premise and the conclusion.
  Choice (B) is similar to the original argument as it concludes that a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly without considering other possible reasons for premature tire wear.

Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole
  B: fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun
  C: focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
  D: fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise
  E: holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument relies on the authority of the study's author instead of on the evidence and proves that chameleons bask for regulating Vitamin D production and basking losses in the sun.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist's reasoning may be unsound based on the conclusion drawn from a small sample size.
  The argument mentions the professionalism and excellence of the author, but this doesn't necessarily guarantee the validity of the study's results, so choice C and E may be incorrect.
  Choice B may be true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on those grounds.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  The argument takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole, so the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on those grounds.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument supports the conclusion that critics' doubts on the study's result are wrong based on the reputation of the author and the small sample size being reasonable. It does not address any other doubts or potential criticisms.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist concludes that the behavior of chameleons is typical of all lizards, which may not be the case.
  The fact that the study's author has a good professional reputation does not guarantee the results are correct.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument defends the study and the author, but doesn't address some issues from the study description.
  The argument might not explain well how the chameleons regulate the vitamin D production.
  The argument doesn't generalize the behavior to other lizard species, although it uses 'lizards such as chameleon'.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The biologist claims that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well-regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. This is a weak argument as it focuses on the author rather than the study itself.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument may be seen as an appeal to authority, by focusing on the author's reputation.
  The argument may be seen as providing inadequate support for the conclusion drawn from the study.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist concludes that the study's critics are wrong to doubt its results because of the author's competence.
  Using the author's professional reputation to support the conclusion is vulnerable to criticism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument provides evidence in favor of the study's conclusion that chameleons bask in the sun to regulate their vitamin D production.
  The critique of the study's small sample size is acknowledged, but it is justified by the author's reputation.

Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago because library subscription rates have increased dramatically while publishing costs have remained constant. In order to weaken this argument, we need an answer that challenges this assumption.
Action: Answer("D")

The argument is that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago. 
If one of the choices shows this is not true, then the argument will be weakened.

Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on the difference between the increase in subscription rates and the costs of publishing a scholarly journal.
  We need to find an option that contradicts the premise that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that increased subscription rates mean that publishing a scholarly journal is more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  We need to find an answer choice that shows this is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that the increasing subscription rates are not justified since publishing costs have not increased.
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide a reason for the rising subscription rates other than profits.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that an increase in subscription rate implies the profitability of publishing a scholarly journal has also increased.
  We need to find a statement that weakens the relation between profitable publishing and subscription rates.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument suggests that the high cost of a scholarly journal subscription means that publishers must be making a lot more money now compared to the point several years ago. So, information that logically opposes this premise would weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation:
Option C says that publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money. This option opposes the idea that publishers are making a lot more profit now compared to several years ago. If it is true that publishers cannot survive financially because of the increased subscription rates, then the argument that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable today is weakened by this information. Options A, B, D and E are irrelevant or do not oppose the premise of the argument.
Response 7:
Thought: To weaken the argument, we need a statement that suggests otherwise. If publishing the journals is actually not much more profitable, then it will weaken the argument.
A: Talks about charging fines, not about how profitable journals are.
B: Doesn't disprove it.
C: This statement actually goes in favour of the argument. It supports that publishers cannot survive without making a profit.
D: If subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years, then this statement goes against the argument that profit from the scholarly journals has increased dramatically.
E: Talks about the frequency of publishing journals. Nothing about the cost and profitability of the journals. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: The argument is that since the subscription rates to a scholarly journal have increased dramatically and the cost of publishing a scholarly journal has remained fairly constant, publishing a scholarly journal must be more profitable now.
To weaken the argument we need to find an answer that shows the assumption is not true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument discusses the net profitability of publishing scholarly articles. Increased subscription rates imply increased profitability for publishers, but we need to find the option that points out that the situation stated in the argument does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that publishing scholarly articles is more profitable now.
  
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
Option C points out that publishing scholarly journals is an expensive business, and publishers cannot consistently make profits if they lose money. This option implies that publishers have additional costs that may affect their profits, and they may face losses even when subscription rates go up. Thus, the argument’s conclusion that increased subscription rates imply more profitability may not be wholly accurate. This option contradicts the argument and is the strongest choice compared to other options that do not address issues concerning the financial burden of publishing scholarly articles.

Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that staff became more meticulous in carrying out patient-care duties because they knew their errors were being closely monitored.
  Presumably, staff errors that cause life-threatening injury to a patient are recorded even before the implementation of the plan, and so option A is irrelevant.
  Option B is interesting, but it does not mean that the plan did not cause the decrease in patient injuries at the participating hospitals.
  Option C weakens the argument because recording only some types of errors does not ensure that the decrease in patient injuries is caused by the implementation of the plan.
  Option D supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injury incidence at all hospitals is not coincidental but linked to the release of records and staff review.
  Option E is irrelevant since the argument does not mention staff discipline.
  Therefore, the correct choice is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that the knowledge of monitoring made staff more meticulous.
  The choice that supports this by indicating that the decrease is related to knowledge of monitoring strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the decrease in the incidence of injuries is due to the plan being implemented, and staff became more careful in their work knowing that errors were being monitored. We need to strengthen this argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument mentions that the monitoring played an important role in reducing the incidence of patient injuries.
  We must find an option that strengthens the argument by showing the monitoring was the main contributing factor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that hospital staff became more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties after systematically recording their staff's errors, leading to a decrease in patient injuries. 
  To strengthen the argument, an option which shows the effectiveness of this method can be chosen.
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: 
Option B states that the incidence of patient injuries decreased even in a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan. This shows that the systematic recording of errors might have a significant impact in reducing patient injuries, and strengthens the argument. Options A, C, D and E do not provide information that directly strengthens the argument.
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that the decrease in the incidence of patient injuries at these hospitals is mainly due to staff becoming more meticulous.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that there is a causal relationship between recording errors and making staff more meticulous.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that the incidence of injuries has substantially decreased at the hospitals since they started recording staff errors.
  The argument further assumes that the decrease is due to the staff being more careful upon knowing their errors are recorded.
  We need to find an answer that confirms the idea that knowledge of being monitored made staff more careful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in incidence of patient injuries is directly related to the systematic recording of staff errors.
  Choice B is an alternative reason that could have contributed to this decrease in incidence. All other choices are irrelevant or weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument says that the plan to record errors led to a decrease in injuries caused by staff. 
  Therefore, the option that shows that the decline in injuries could not have been caused by any other factor is most likely to strengthen.
Action: Answer("D")

Topic: Law
Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed
  B: fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects
  C: generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms
  D: takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded
  E: ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
Response 0:
Thought:
  The CEO argues that they have already reduced the amount of pollution significantly, implying that they are already environmentally responsible. However, the CEO fails to consider that there may be alternative methods of production that would allow them to pollute even less.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The CEO suggests that they are environmentally responsible since their current production methods are producing less pollution than before and claims there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
The CEO's reasoning is flawed in that it doesn't consider the possibility of new manufacturing methods that can produce less or no pollution.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The CEO states that there are no currently available methods that do not produce any pollution, which could be a flawed assumption.
  Additionally, the CEO's argument centers on the corporation's reduced pollution rather than its overall environmental responsibility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The CEO argues that the company has attempted to reduce pollution, but there are no methods that do not produce any pollution, so the criticism is false.
  The argument overlooks the possibility that there may be production methods that produce less pollution than the company's current methods.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The CEO defends the company's record by arguing that they are doing all they can to pollute less, but that there is no method that does not produce any pollution.
  It does not consider the possibility of developing new methods that would decrease the amount of pollution produced.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The CEO mentions that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution but does not address the possibility that there are methods that can produce less pollution than their current ones but there are other reasons why they are not using them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The CEO argues that the corporation is environmentally responsible because they produce less pollution now than they did in the past.
  The CEO assumes that there are no methods that do not produce any pollution.
  The argument does not address the possibility that there are currently production methods that produce less pollution than current methods.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The CEO is arguing that the company is environmentally responsible because their current methods pollute less than old methods, and there are no methods that do not pollute.
  The CEO did not take into account the possibility that there may be production methods that would allow the company to pollute even less than their current methods.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The CEO argues that they have been falsely criticized for not being environmentally responsible. 
  The CEO claims that they are currently polluting significantly less than they used to.

Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Larew and Mendota disagree.
  Larew believes the percentage increase in average income of the lowest quintile is greater than that of the highest quintile, and hence their economic prosperity has increased relative to that of the highest quintile.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew and thinks that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was greater for the highest quintile.
  The question is asking what Larew and Mendota are disagreeing about.
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 1:
Thought:
  Larew and Mendota differ on how to measure the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest income quintile.
  Larew thinks that it is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
  Mendota thinks that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Larew believes that the lowest quintile's percentage increase in average income was higher.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew on the basis that the absolute amount of increase in average income was greater for the highest quintile.
  The above discussion relates to whether the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income versus absolute amount of increase.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
Larew and Mendota have different opinions on the measure of economic prosperity between the lowest and the highest income quintile.
Larew believes that the percentage change of the average income captures the relative change in the prosperity of each quintile.
Mendota disputes Larew's claims and states that the most abundant change in economic prosperity between the two quintiles is measured by the absolute change in income.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Larew and Mendota have different opinions about the relationship between the percentage and the absolute amount of increased income.
  The context says that the percentage of increased average income is higher in the lowest quintile.
  Mendota thinks that the absolute amount of increased average income is greater in the highest quintile.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
- Larew believes that the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile increased relative to the highest quintile's, because even though the percentage increase was higher for the lowest quintile, she didn't say that the absolute amount of the increase was greater than the highest quintile's.
- Mendota disagrees and thinks that the "absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile"
 Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Larew claims the percentage increase in average income is higher for the lowest quintile than that of the highest quintile, implying that their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's and Mendota disagrees, claiming that the absolute amount of the increase in average income is surely greater for the highest quintile. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Larew argues that the people in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income than those in the highest quintile, meaning their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's.
  Mendota disagrees with Larew's argument, saying that while the lowest quintile's income may have increased by a greater percentage, the absolute amount of the increase in the highest quintile was greater.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Larew thinks the percentage increase in income can measure the relative economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile as compared to the highest quintile.
  Mendota disagrees. He thinks the examination should be based on absolute values.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetlands to protect wildlife.
  For this argument to be valid, the construction of replacement wetlands must necessarily provide a sufficient habitat for the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission argument proposes that the development of wetlands must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife nations, and Figorian Development Commission argument is that other nations have developed their wetlands at the expense of wildlife, so they should be allowed to develop. So, to support this argument, the assumption required here is something that supports the notion that developing the wetlands in Figoria won't pose any threat to the species that inhabit them.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument by the Figorian Wildlife Commission advocates for regulated wetland development where new development must be offset by construction of replacement wetland habitats.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetlands, so wildlife will be protected.
  The answer choice that the argument depends upon would be something that the argument requires to be true in order for its conclusion to make sense.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We need to identify the assumption that will make the argument valid.
  The argument concludes that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats and thus cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the endangered species.
  The assumption will be a belief that the above conclusion holds true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: The argument suggests that the future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife. The assumption must be logically connected to this point and is necessary for the argument put forward by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  Option A is about comparing wetland development with other kinds of development. It is a fact-based statement and not a logical connection and cannot be considered as an assumption.
  Option B, assuming that the species will survive in replacement wetlands, is necessary for the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  Option C talks about agricultural nations, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D is about Figorian regulation in the past, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E is about Figorian wetland species, which may not be relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's argument is about protecting wildlife of the wetlands.
  The Commission's argument can only be valid if it is assumed that the replacement wetland habitats will effectively protect the wildlife of the wetland from the threat of development.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission concludes that to protect wildlife, the Figorian government should regulate wetland development. 
The assumption on which this argument depends must be related to the effectiveness of the proposed regulation. If the mandated offsetting construction of replacement wetland habitats is insufficient or impractical, then the regulation would be ineffective in protecting the wildlife.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that development of Figorian wetlands should be regulated to protect wildlife. Therefore, the assumption must relate to the argument for the regulation of wetland development.
  Choices A and C are irrelevant to the argument and the choices D and E may be true, but they don't relate directly to the conclusion of the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends on an assumption.
  The argument is about protecting wildlife by regulating wetland development.
  The assumption should be related to the effectiveness of the regulation to protect wildlife.

Context: In order to relieve traffic congestion, the city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area. However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps, to explain the increase in average commute time?
Choices:
  A: Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs.
  B: The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs.
  C: Shortly after the new highway was opened, several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights.
  D: At the same time the new highway was being built,. road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner.
  E: In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The premise is that the construction of the highway increased average commute time in downtown Gastner.
  The question asks for an explanation for this.
  Choice A is irrelevant; where people commute from doesn't explain the city's downtown traffic increase.
  Choice B is also irrelevant; convenience for suburban commuters doesn't explain why roadway congestion increased.
  Choice C doesn't help explain the situation; upgrading suburban roads doesn't explain why congestion in downtown Gastner's streets increased.
  Choice D is irrelevant; the repair work is done on the streets leading to downtown Gastner, not on the highway.
Action: Answer("E")   
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The new highway linking several suburbs to downtown Gastner may have attracted more drivers to commute into Gastner. 
  An increase in the number of drivers on the road may lead to congestion and increased commute times, even if the new highway eliminates traffic within the suburbs.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The new highway linking several of the suburbs to the downtown area increased the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner.
  We need an explanation to understand why the average commute time increased.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  Yet, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
  To help address this discrepancy, we need to find an answer choice that connects the increased commute time to the new highway despite its purpose of relieving traffic congestion
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The new highway was constructed to reduce traffic congestion.
  The average commuting time increased after the highway was opened. 
  The answer should explain how the new highway was not able to meet its objective of reducing traffic congestion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The new highway is supposed to relieve congestion, not add to it.
  If more people are commuting from downtown to the suburbs, the increase in average commute time cannot be explained.
  The location of the new highway is not relevant if traffic is increasing.
  The road upgrades are not relevant if traffic is increasing.
  The road repair work is not relevant if traffic is increasing.
  If traffic near the new highway is becoming congested as a result of the new highway, it may take even longer to commute through the downtown area.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The new highway was built to relieve traffic congestion.
  However, the average commute time for workers increased after the new highway was opened.
  We need an option that explains the increase in commute time after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The new highway was linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area.
  The average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The new highway linking suburbs to downtown area may have attracted more people to use private transport.
  Option A could be a part of the explanation as there could be an increase in the number of people using the new highway to access the downtown area. 
  However, option B looks like a better explanation as the convenience of the new highway for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs will likely increase the usage of the new highway. This could increase congestion within downtown Gastner leading to increased commute time. 
  Option C and D do not seem to be the best explanations for the increase in commute time.
  Option E is tempting but it does not fully explain the increase in average commute time after the new highway was opened.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the penalty is too severe given the current evidence, so we need stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility before we can impose the penalty.
  Choice A seems to capture this reasoning well.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can't justify imposing the penalty because it's too severe given the evidence we currently have
  The principle being sought must help to justify the argument's reasoning
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that unless stronger evidence or an admission of guilt is found, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  This is based on the idea that penalty should only be imposed when one is sufficiently certain of guilt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: The argument is about justifying the reasoning that the penalty cannot be imposed on the auto repair shop without stronger evidence. Hence, the principle that deals with the sufficient justification of a penalty is valid.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the need for stronger evidence before imposing the penalty of a severe offense.
  The principle that most helps to justify this reasoning is the one that claims a need for sufficient certainty of guilt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the severity of the penalty and how it affects the decision to impose it.
  The reasoning used in the argument is that unless stronger evidence is discovered, the penalty cannot be justified.
  The principle that would most help to justify the reasoning in the argument should be one that relates to how the severity of the penalty affects the decision to impose it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that the penalty should not be imposed.
  The argument suggests that the uncertainty about the identity of the polluter is due to the severity of the penalty.
  The answer that most justifies that reasoning is likely to be a principle that states that "severe penalties require strong evidence."
  Option A seems to capture that principle.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument is saying that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that we need stronger evidence or the perpetrator to admit responsibility.
  If there is severe punishment, we need stronger evidence to establish the guilt of the polluter.
  This resembles choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument suggests that the penalty for pollution is so high that unless they find additional and stronger evidence or the polluter admits to it, it's not justified to impose the penalty on them. This means that if the penalty was less severe, they would need less evidence to impose a penalty. This aligns with choice E. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The speaker is saying that the penalty for the offense is severe and requires more evidence before the penalty can be applied.
  This suggests that the principle being used is the one that relates to the severity of penalties and the certainty of guilt.
  The answer should state that penalties require reasonable evidence.

Topic: Law
Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The professor's statements assert the following:
    - Epic poetry's most important function is to transmit values.
    - This transmission is accomplished by embodiment in heroic figures who are presented as role models.
    - Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Among the answer choices:
    - Choice A is a general statement about poetry and does not directly relate to epic poetry transmitting values through heroic figures as role models.
    - Choice C claims that values represented in poetry are rarely stated explicitly, but the professor only suggests that values are transmitted implicitly.
    - Choice E is contradicted by the existence of other types of poetry that can present heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question requires us to determine which statement is true based on the given information.
  The professor's statements are about the function of epic poetry.
  The main function of epic poetry is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models, allowing people to follow their examples and live according to the values represented in the poetry.
  Based on this, the statement that "Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models" is true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question is asking us to identify what must be specifically true based on the statement made by the professor.
  The statement made by the professor is that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
  Additionally, that it is accomplished through the embodiment of those values in heroic figures presented as role models.
  Therefore, what must be true given the Professor's statement?
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The statement says that epic poetry uses heroic figures as role models to transmit values. It also implies that people find meaning and direction from the values represented in poetry. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
The professor's statement is that, through embodying heroic figures, epic poetry transmits the values by which a group of people is to live. It follows that the most important function of epic poetry is accomplished by presenting heroic figures as role models (Option B). Option A is too broad in its scope to be the correct answer. The professor's statement does not speak for all poetry, but merely holds that the most important function for epic poetry is to transmit values, as stated above. Option C may be true, but it is not mentioned in the professor's statement. Option D is close to the initial statement but concerns "many groups of people," whereas the professor's statement is more specific in indicating a particular group of people. Finally, Option E cannot be true because the professor's statement does not indicate that only epic poetry has this function, but merely asserts that epic poetry accomplishes this transmittal of values in the way described.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The professor claims that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values of a group of people who hear it by embodying heroic figures presented as role models. The statement is general and indicates a few important points that need to be considered.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The professor's statement claims that epic poetry transmits values by presenting heroic figures as role models. 
  This means that an important function of epic poetry is to present heroic figures as role models.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
The professor's statement is focused on epic poetry and its function of transmitting values through heroic figures presented as role models. To select the correct answer, it is important to look for a statement that must be true if the professor's statements are true, despite not being explicitly mentioned.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
In the professor's statement, the most significant way by which epic poetry conveys values is through presenting heroic figures as role models to its audience. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The professor states that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by presenting heroic figures as role models for imitation.
  From this statement, it can be deduced that:
    - This function is central to the importance of poetry.
    - Heroic figures are presented as role models to transmit values.
    - Imitation of role models presented in the poetry results in meaning and direction.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument could be criticized if it overlooks any possibility that questions this claim.
  Option (A) points out a possibility that some new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders may have saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument concludes that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  We need to find the criticism which can weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes most people could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka from their current auto insurance policy.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds.
  Answer choice A and D are similar but they do not criticize the argument based on a logical fallacy.
  Answer choice B is unrelated to the argument. The argument is about the savings one can make by switching to Popelka, regardless of how long they have been with the company.
  Answer choice C  implies that Popelka is less affordable than some other insurance company which is not mentioned in the argument.
  Answer choice E is logically correct because the population of people who can switch to Popelka and would save a lot of money could be different than the population of people who already have Popelka insurance. This makes the argument flawed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument in the advertisement claims that most people can save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka Auto Insurance, based on a survey of new policyholders. 
It is vulnerable if the survey was misleading for any reasons or if the survey results were not representative of the entire population.
Action: Answer("A")

Response 6:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka. 
  The argument could be criticized on different grounds. 
  (A) and (D) are not relevant as the advertisement does not make claims about all the policyholders surveyed.
  (B) This claim is not taken for granted in the advertisement.
  (C) This is the claim that most affects Popelka. If other companies could provide better rates than Popelka, then the advertisement's claim would be false.
  (E) This possibility does not affect the claim of the advertisement.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The advertisement claims that switching to Popelka Auto Insurance could save policyholders hundreds of dollars.
  The argument could be criticized if the savings are not accurate or if Popelka's premiums are still higher than other companies' premiums.
  Choice A addresses the possibility that some new policyholders saved little or no money.
  Choice B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C changes the subject to argue about a hypothetical scenario that is not relevant to the advertisement.
  Choice D is irrelevant and does not address the argument.
  Choice E does not criticize the argument directly.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The advertisement suggests that most people can save by switching to Popelka Auto Insurance.
  Options A and D both suggest that the survey may not be representative or accurate. However, option D is talking about policyholders misunderstanding their savings and is less likely to be a criticism of the argument in the advertisement.
  Option B does not make sense, as the argument is talking about helping people who are not policyholders of Popelka's.
  Option E may suggest that the advertisement is misrepresenting the savings, which is a legitimate criticism. However, the argument is not particularly vulnerable because it does talk about savings on average. 
  Option C is the most effective criticism, as it suggests a possibility that is not considered by the advertisement.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The second group of doctors advocates natural defenses of the brain, that prevent the bilirubin from entering.
  It should be something that strengthens the case of the second group who advocates letting bilirubin levels remain high and promoting natural brain defenses. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors suggests that the brain's own natural defenses prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find a statement that supports the second group's position.
  If some diseases can weaken the natural defenses of the brain, bilirubin might enter the brain, which means reducing the high levels of bilirubin is the best option.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues that high levels of bilirubin should be allowed to remain since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We need to find an answer that supports this position.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Choice B supports the second group's argument because the weakening of the brain's natural defenses allows bilirubin to enter and cause tetanus, which could be prevented by allowing high levels of bilirubin to remain. None of the other choices establish such a link.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The second group argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  The question asks for the option that most supports this position of the second group. 
Action: Answer("B")     
  If some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, this statement most supports the second group's position that bilirubin levels in newborn babies should be allowed to remain high, and suggests that treating all newborns with high bilirubin may not be necessary.
Response 4:
Thought:
The second group of doctors advocates for allowing bilirubin levels to remain high because the brain's natural defenses prevent it from entering. 
We need to find an option that supports this argument.
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation:
Choice B is the correct answer. It states that some diseases can weaken the brain's natural defenses and hence allow bilirubin to enter. This supports the second group's argument that babies should not be treated to reduce bilirubin since the brain can fend it off naturally. Choices A, C, D and E do not directly relate to the argument or support it.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors allows bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, arguing that the brain's natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  We are looking for an option that supports the second group's position.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Option (B) strengthens the position of the second group of doctors by stating that some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter, which is in line with their argument that the brain's natural defenses are sufficient to prevent bilirubin from entering. Therefore, option (B) best supports the position of the second group of doctors.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors believe that high levels of bilirubin are not harmful because the brain's natural defense is effective.
  To support the position of the second group of doctors, one needs to show evidence that brain's defense is effective and can mitigate the risk even with high levels of bilirubin.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The second group of doctors is arguing for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high. So, they need evidence to support their claim that letting bilirubin levels remain high is better for newborns.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  The correct answer choice should give evidence of the natural defenses of the brain against bilirubin
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Answer choice B is correct because if some diseases occur in newborns, they can weaken the brain's natural defenses against bilirubin allowing it to enter. This supports the position of the second group of doctors who argue that bilirubin levels in babies should remain high due to the existence of natural defense mechanisms in the brain.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies.
  This group suggests that brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
  If some diseases weaken the brain's natural defenses, then this position can be supported.

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
  The premise states that Group A was better than Group B in remembering to make a telephone call at a specified time.
  We need to identify the statement that doesn't support the conclusion.
  
Action: Answer("C").  
Explanation:   
  Statement C is unrelated to the conclusion and the facts presented in the argument.
Response 1:
Thought:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  

Explanation: 
All other answer choices are either directly pertinent to the study and its methodology, or relevant to the control conditions to which both groups were subjected. Choice C, however, while conceivably relevant, hardly helps to establish that the conclusion above is properly drawn.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages based on a study where Group A (65-75 years old) performed better than Group B (college students) in making a telephone call at a specific time.
  Thus, the factor that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion can be identified.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")  
Thought:
  The conclusion drawn from the study is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, as Group A (people 65-75 years old) performed much better than Group B (college students). Since option C provides information about the age range of college students, it is least helpful in establishing the conclusion. It does not help determine whether or not aging has an impact on memory. Meanwhile, the other options support the study's validity by controlling for possible alternative explanations.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, just because Group A performed better than Group B.
  To establish that conclusion, it is important that Group A and B only differ in terms of age and are similar in other aspects.

Topic: Law
Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity.
Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the town has a relatively small number of houses
  B: inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe
  C: structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage
  D: many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe
  E: some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The resident claims that 60% of the houses in their town have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity due to 30% of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  The question asks for another possibility that the resident argument does not consider.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The resident argues that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have problems that threaten their integrity and supports this claim by stating that 30 percent of the houses have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects. 
  The argument overlooks the possibility that houses can have none of the problems mentioned in the argument. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: The resident is concluding that at least 60 percent of town's houses have some kind of problems. But, the argument overlooks other possibilities.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The resident claims that at least 60% of houses have integrity problems by only taking into account the percentage of houses with inadequate site drainage and structural defects. 
  It is possible that many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: The resident's argument states that "at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity" because 30% have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects. The argument is susceptible to an issue of double-counting houses that have both problems.
Action: Answer ("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the assumption that all the houses that have a particular issue share the same houses as a subset. This is flawed since it is possible for the houses to have the same issue or have different issues.
  Choice D, if it is true, would weaken the resident's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The resident is drawing a conclusion that at least 60% of the houses have some problem.
The argument is based on the assumption that the problems are independent of each other.
The argument overlooks the possibility that some houses have both, inadequate site drainage and structural defects that could make them unsafe.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The resident's argument is based on two premises: inadequate site drainage and structural defects threatening the integrity of the houses.
  The resident concludes that at least 60% of houses in the town have some problems that threaten their integrity.
  The argument, however, jumps from a specific percentage to a general conclusion.
  The argument overlooks other possibilities, the presented premises alone do not necessarily support the conclusion.
  We need to find a possibility overlooked in the argument.
  Choice D provides such a possibility.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The resident's argument states that 30% of houses have inadequate site drainage and 30% have structural defects.
  The argument fails to consider the possibility that some houses may not have any issues that threaten their integrity.
  The correct answer choice will address the possibility of houses having no problems.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The resident concludes that at least 60 percent of the town's houses have some kind of problem.
The resident's argument considers two types of problems.
The resident's reasoning assumes that there are no overlaps between inadequate site drainage and structural defects.

Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an explanation of why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than those of the most common species in a tropical forest.
  The passage describes a pattern and does not provide an explanation for the phenomenon.
  We are to select the answer that best helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species in the forest.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks for an explanation for why rare species of trees tend to survive longer than common species.
  The fact there is no introduction of any new species to the tropical forests is not relevant to explain the situation.
  Option A does not provide details on the survival of rarer species of trees.
  Option B does not elaborate on the rarer species of trees surviving longer.
  Option D may provide insight, but it doesn't seem to explain why rare species of trees survive longer.
  Option E seems plausible because rare species may have less competition for resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The question asks which statement explains why the rare species tend to survive longer than the common ones.
The given information is that the trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer regardless of which species is common or rare.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an explanation as to why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer.
  Choice E provides a reason for this in that the trees of the common species have more competition for resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The study found that rare species tend to survive longer. We need to explain why rare species survive longer than the common ones.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We are given that regardless of which species is most common or rare, trees of the rare species tend to survive longer.
  We need an explanation for why trees of the rarest species survive longer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The question asks for the explanation that best helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species given the context of the study.
  This explanation should connect the rarity of a species with its survival in some way.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The question asks about what helps explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species. 
  We need to find an answer choice that provides an explanation for this pattern.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question asks us to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species.
  Choice E might support this; trees of the common species have more competition for resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
  The explanation for why rarer species survive longer might be due to the competition for resources.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an explanation of why the rarest species tend to survive longer. 
  Option A discusses why the most common species thrives in that environment and does not explain the survival of the rarest species.
  Option B discusses the low reproductive rate of older trees and is not related to the survival of rarest species.
  Option C clarifies the conditions of the study and does not explain the survival of the rarest species.
  Option D provides a possible explanation for why the survival of trees of the rarer species might be important, but it does not explain why rare species tend to survive longer than common species.
  Option E explains why the trees of the rare species tend to survive longer than the trees of the common species.

Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The conclusion of the argument is that Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed is wrong. 
  The answer choice that would help enable this conclusion is one that supports the idea that knowing a lot about an action does not determine its status as freely performed.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The Ethicist argues that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know enough about the events leading up to that action.
  To draw the conclusion, we need to find an assumption that supports the Ethicist's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is about when we are justified in praising or blaming a person for their actions.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing more about the events that led to an action would change our view of whether the action was freely performed.
  We need to find an assumption here that enables the above conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that we should not reject the idea that we can praise or blame people for their actions, even if we know a lot about the events leading up to the action. 
  The correct assumption should support the reasoning in the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that Tolstoy's claim is rash.
  Tolstoy's claim is that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The author concludes by stating that when we know a lot about the events leading up to an action, we are justified in praising or blaming a person for that action.
  The assumption must be related to why Tolstoy's claim is rash.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that we can only praise or blame someone for their actions when we know a lot of the events leading up to the action. The assumption that would enable the conclusion to be properly drawn is the one that relates to this claim.
  Options A, B, D, and E either do not relate to this idea or only partially cover the idea.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The ethicist supports the idea of justifying blame/praise when we know enough about the events leading up to an action.
  The conclusion that should be drawn is that Tolstoy's claim is not correct and we won't cease to regard actions as free even if we knew enough about the events leading up to the action.
  I need to find the answer choice that enables this conclusion to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a case against Tolstoy's claim.
  The argument is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim of regarding an action as not freely performed if we knew a lot about the events leading up to it.
  The assumption has to be about how much information is required to justify praising or blaming an action.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument of the ethicist is that we need to know a lot about events before we can justify praising or blaming people for their actions. We need to reject Tolstoy’s claim that more details about events leading up to any action exculpates the person performing the action.
Action: Answer("B") 
  If an act for which the person is responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, then the conclusion of the ethicist's argument that knowledge of events is crucial before blaming or praising people for their action, follows as factual.
Response 9:
Thought: 
The conclusion of the ethicist is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim and that we can praise or blame someone for an action only if we have knowledge of the events leading up to it. Therefore, the answer should support this argument.

Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The economist suggests trading goods or services from an urban population to obtain agricultural products previously produced domestically.
  We need to find a statement that supports the notion of trading goods or services for agricultural products in addressing the problem of urbanization.

Thought:
  The assertion made by economists is that urbanization can be tackled effectively by trading urban goods for agricultural products.
  We need an option that shows this assertion to be true.
Action: Answer("C")   
Explanation:
  Option C states that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. This confirms the view of the economists that trading urban goods with rural areas to acquire agricultural products can help tackle the problems created by urbanization.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population would solve the problem created by increasing urbanization.
  We need to find the option that most supports this statement.
Action: Answer("C")

Topic: Law
Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion
  D: confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause
  E: relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist concludes that the claims of supplement manufacturers are correct because a study found that ingesting melatonin alleviated insomnia symptoms.
  There could be other factors that play a role in insomnia. 
  The study only included people aged 65-81. 
  The pharmacist assumes that insomnia is solely due to a decrease in melatonin caused by aging.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The pharmacist's argument is about a study on people aged 65-81, who suffered from insomnia.
   The study showed that melatonin improved most of the symptoms.
   The pharmacist concludes from this study that claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct.
  The conclusion is flawed because the study does not prove the claim made by the manufacturers of the melatonin supplement that pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages. 
  Thus the argument is confusing the effect of the condition with the cause of the condition.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The pharmacist claims that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting Melatonin.
  The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements regarding Pineal gland's production of melatonin with age are correct.
  The pharmacist fails to establish the causal relationship between the Pineal gland's production of melatonin and the alleviation of symptoms of insomnia.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 3:
Thought:
  The pharmacist concludes that recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The pharmacist's conclusion is based on the fact that a study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The pharmacist assumes that manufacturers' claims are correct just because melatonin helps with alleviating insomnia.
  It is possible for other factors to contribute to the improvement of symptoms, and melatonin may not be the direct cause.
  The claims made by the manufacturer may not be correct even if melatonin helps with alleviating insomnia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The pharmacist argues that recent claims about melatonin supplements must be correct because they alleviate symptoms of insomnia in older individuals. 
  The claim is that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as we age. 
  The pharmacist is using the effect of taking melatonin supplements to infer that the claim must be correct.
  This is a classic flaw of confusing correlation with causation.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 6:
Thought:
  The pharmacist argues that the claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct based on a study.
  The argument may be flawed if it suffers from a certain logical fallacy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The pharmacist claims that the claims of the manufacturers of melatonin supplements are correct because a study showed that ingesting melatonin alleviates insomnia symptoms.
  The pharmacist may be conflating a correlation (effect of taking melatonin) with a causation (the reason the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The study shows that melatonin can reduce the symptoms of insomnia.
  The pharmacist concludes that the producers' claims that pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  Whether melatonin reduces the symptoms of insomnia is not relevant to producers' claims about melatonin levels in the pineal gland as we age.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The pharmacist claims that recent claims by manufacturers are correct based on a study.
  The study concluded that most insomnia symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist concludes that it is correct that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.

Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnets are effective to relieve some back pain in the experiment.
  The question asks for a counter to the argument.
  The strongest counter should weaken the conclusion drawn by the physician.
Action: Answer("B")

  We need to find the counter statement that directly attack the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The physician uses the experiment to support the claim that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. The answer that constitutes the logically strongest counter would undermine the physician's claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  To counter the physician's argument, we need to show that magnetic fields may not be the reason for the reduction in back pain in the first group.
  Option A shows that the knowledge of treatment can lead to improvement.
  Option B is not relevant, as the argument is not about which medication is more effective.
  Option C is not relevant to the argument either, as the argument is specifically about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in reducing back pain.
  Option D suggests that there was some bias involved in the experiment but it doesn't provide a direct counter to the physician's argument.
  Option E indicates that the variation in the causes of back pain could have influenced the results, providing a counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most patients reported a significant reduction in pain after the treatment.
  We need to choose the choice that is the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The physician concluded that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on a small experiment.
  The logical strongest counter would be something that undermines the conclusion. Other choices don't necessarily undermine the conclusion as strongly as one of them does.
  Option A suggests an alternative explanation for the reduction in pain. Option B makes a statement about physician's beliefs, which may or may not be true, but does not challenge the conclusion. Option C is related, but does not challenge the conclusion about the back pain specifically. Option D suggests that those who designed the experiment may be biased, but it still doesn't challenge the conclusion. Option E, on the other hand, could show that some other factor was responsible for the observed effect rather than magnetic fields.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective based on the evidence from the experiments.

Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result?
Choices:
  A: For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
  B: Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices.
  C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.
  D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
  E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Surprisingly, the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers. 
  The most plausible reason for the surprising result since most customers are not price-sensitive is that they were drawn to the particularly visible display of Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("C")

  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  We need to find an option that can explain why Styron hammers were sold more than Maxlast hammers.
  Option A does not mention the hammers or the sale, and the timing of shoppers entering the store is also not crucial.
  Option B also focuses on general customer preferences, not on the hammers or the sale.
  Option C indicates that the sale had an impact on Maxlast hammer sales, but it does not explain why Styron hammers were sold more than Maxlast hammers.
  Option D implies that the sale was advertised and may have brought in more customers, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item may not motivate shoppers to visit the store. However, this does not explain why those shoppers who visited the store bought more of the Styron hammers than the Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The surprising part is that despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance, the Styron hammers slightly outsold them.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  Option C explains the surprising result because it suggests that customers might have bought Maxlast hammers just because they were on sale but that does not mean the customers preferred Maxlast hammers over Styron hammers. Therefore, that is why Styron hammers slightly outsold Maxlast hammers.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The store put all Maxlast hammers on sale and placed them in a display case just inside the store entrance.
  Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Despite all Maxlast hammers put on sale, the sales figures are lower than Styron Hammers.
  Correct option should explain why Styron sales were more despite Maxlast hammers were on sale.
Action: Answer("D")  
Explanation: 
  Option D explains the possible reason for the sales of Styron hammers being more. The hardware store circulated Flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, which attracted shoppers, encouraging them to come to the store to buy Maxlast Hammers. Thus, they noticed the Styron Hammers and might have purchased them.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers, which were on sale.
  The sale of Maxlast hammers may result in decreased number of shoppers buying Styron hammers.
  Option C suggests the reason why some customers bought Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The surprising result is that Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers despite the latter being on sale.
  We need to find a reason that explains why the sale of Maxlast hammers did not result in more sales compared to Styron hammers.

Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez, since Lopez eventually won the election.
  We need to find an answer choice that weakens this argument.
  Answer choice B, which states that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, would suggest that there was no bias in favor of Lopez in the surveys conducted after the debate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument posits that those who thought Lopez had made better arguments may have been biased. The answer choice undermining this posits that an objective measure of the debate and election outcome may not have aligned with respondent opinions. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The survey respondents who report Lopez's arguments might be biased, because he eventually won.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Option B weakens the argument the most as the survey of live audience watching the debate who rejected Lopez as less persuasive than Tanner, who could not win the debate, shows that there was at least one sample of people who did not favor Lopez much. Therefore, the results of the survey could have been biased towards Lopez. On the other hand, if most of the viewers surveyed prior to the debate (Option D), or people who watched the debate (Option C) preferred Tanner, the argument would have been strengthened as it would have shown that there was some inherent quality in Lopez's arguments that won the election, which viewers and voters could pick up intuitively. Option A is irrelevant, and option E might support the argument. 
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez, and provides evidence that Lopez eventually won the election.
  We need to find the choice that weakens this argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the survey respondents who favored Lopez may have been biased in his/her favor and hence question the reliability of the survey findings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the viewers who reported that Lopez had better arguments may have been biased in favor of him because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument we need to present a possibility that gives another explanation to why the viewers thought Lopez had better arguments.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the survey is not reliable since the survey respondents may have been biased.
  The answer should state a reason why it is still reliable.
  If a large proportion of voters did not base their decision on the debate, or thought Tanner was more persuasive, then the survey may not reflect the voters who decided based on the debate, making it unreliable.
Solution: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is stating that the survey respondents in favor of Lopez's argument may have been biased.
  We need to find a scenario that contradicts the assertion that Lopez's winning of the election is as a result of biased survey respondents.
  By this contradiction, we can determine the point that most seriously undermines the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that people who thought Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he eventually won the election.
  Therefore, the answer should target the likelihood of bias in the survey.
Action: Answer("B")  
  Explanation: 
  Option B states that most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. This undermines the argument because it shows that the survey results may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that the viewers surveyed may have been biased in favor of Lopez since he eventually won the election.
  We need to find a statement that undermines this argument.
  Option B tells us that the surveyed audience thought that Tanner was more persuasive.

Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument against Riley's characterisation of the president's speech is flawed, let's see why.
  The argument assumes that it is wrong for Riley to characterise the president's speech as inflammatory because she had a long-standing feud with the president.
  The argument concludes that the speech was not inflammatory, unless some independent evidence suggests that it actually was.
  The argument does not address other factors that might render the speech inappropriate or inflammatory, such as specific audience considerations.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The conclusion seems reasonable to me based on the provided premises. 
  It's saying that we should be careful to not just take Professor Riley's testimony as definitive proof that the speech was inappropriate because it's possible that Riley may just be biased against the university president.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")  
The argument assumes that if the university president's speech is not inflammatory, it cannot be deemed inappropriate. However, there could be other reasons why the speech is inappropriate besides being inflammatory. Therefore, choice A is the best answer.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")  
The argument assumes that if the president's speech was not inflammatory, then it was not inappropriate. However, a speech, even if it does not contain inflammatory statements, may still be inappropriate for other reasons. Therefore, the argument takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument is arguing that the speech was not inflammatory.
  Its premise is based on the fact that Professor Riley has a long-standing feud with the president.
  The argument is flawed in that the conclusion the argument makes, is not based on any independent evidence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
Explanation:
The argument assumes that if the speech was not inflammatory, then it must not be inappropriate. This is a false assumption, as a speech may still be inappropriate for other reasons even if it is not inflammatory. Therefore, the argument is flawed.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
   The argument criticizes the basis for the claim, not the claim itself.
   The argument does not ignore facts other than Riley's testimony. 
   The argument does consider the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences.
   The argument does not favor the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing.
   The argument concludes that Riley's claim cannot be accepted as true without independent reasons.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument supports the idea that the president's speech was not inappropriate if it is not considered inflammatory.
  It concludes that Riley's claim is false solely based on the premise that Riley and the president have a long-standing feud.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("A") 
The argument is flawed in that it takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory. The argument suggests that the speech couldn't be inappropriate unless it was inflammatory. However, there could be other reasons why it could be inappropriate other than being inflammatory.

Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The government used a new program to determine the number of people employed in Country X.
  The program counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X to estimate employment.
  In the first quarter that the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses or commissions.
  The government reported a large increase in employment.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The new computer program estimated employment by counting paychecks per pay period. 
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular, overtime pay, bonuses and commissions. 
  This issue suggests employees are over-reported in the new program.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  - The new government computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers
  - The government reported a significant increase in the number of people employed in the first quarter for which the program was used.
  - Some X workers receive more than one paycheck per pay period
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The government used a new program to determine the number of people employed.
  The program counted the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers.
  During the first quarter the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  The large increase in employment reported by the government may have been inflated because the new program did not account for multiple paychecks issued by some employers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country in 1988.
  The new program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X.

  The computer program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X to estimate employment.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, and bonuses and commissions.
  This suggests that the tallied number of paychecks could potentially overestimate the number of people employed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The new program tallies the number of paychecks per pay period to estimate the number of people employed in X.
  In the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for different things.
  The government reported a large increase in employment from the first quarter for which the program was used.
  That means the new program registered more paychecks for employment than before.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The government's new computer program tallies the number of paychecks issued per period to estimate employment.
  Some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  Therefore, the government may have counted one employee as multiple employees, overestimating the total number of employed people in X.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The new computer program is measuring the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers X. 
  Some of the workers in X receive multiple checks every pay period: one for the regular hours, one for overtime, and one for bonuses/commissions.
  These multi-check situations could lead to overestimating the number of people employed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The new computer program counted the number of paychecks per pay period to determine the employment rate.
  In the first quarter that the program was used, some employers issued separate paychecks for regular hours, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.
  This implies that some employees received more than one paycheck per pay period.
  Therefore, the count of paychecks may not accurately represent the number of employed individuals.
  Since the government reported a large increase in employment, it is possible that the count is overestimated.

Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the company's net income from sales must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because of the decline in market share, which is flawed and could be caused by other factors as well.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument discusses a decline in Wilson Appliance's market share of hair dryers, but doesn't provide exact sales data or other possible factors that could have influenced the net income.
  Therefore, we need to look for an answer choice that matches with the flaw of the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's product accounts for a lower proportion of all hair dryer sales. 
  The argument assumes that the market for hair dryers has not changed and does not mention the number of hair dryers sold by the company. 
  The argument assumes that the net income per hair dryer has remained constant over the five-year period. 
Action: Answer("A")

Context: Critic: The recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him. It is by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and so does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. But it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: There is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries.
  B: The life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting.
  C: Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time.

Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The scientist claims that the species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, but the premise is based on the assumption that there was no other way for the iguanas to get to the islands. Therefore, any information that provides another possibility, destroys the argument. 
Option D is the best choice because if fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, then the iguana must have reached the islands from Australia not from the Americas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the iguanas must have rafted on floating debris from the Americas to the small group of islands near Australia.
  We need to find an answer that makes it less likely the iguanas rafted from America.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The scientist argues that the iguana species living on the group of islands came from the Americas through rafting. A choice that contradicts this argument would weaken it.
  Choice A provides information that does not necessarily relate to the argument being made.
  Choice B would support the idea of rafting across the Pacific because the genetic differences could have developed after the crossing.
  Choice C disputes the idea of rafting but with general statements, not about iguanas and therefore will not weaken the argument.
  Choice D is a weakness issue raised that undermines the rafting hypothesis.
  Choice E gives information but not what could weaken the argument being made, so it is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the iguana species must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas because the islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana. 
  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests a possible alternative explanation for the presence of the iguana species. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The scientist argues that the species must have rafted on floating debris because the islands formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana.
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide an alternate explanation for how the species got to the islands.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If some related species of iguanas were already present on other islands near the one in question, their progenitors might have simply migrated over.
  If it can be shown that other species native to the Americas could not have made the journey by rafting, the argument must fall apart.
  If fossils of closely related iguana species have already been found in Australia, it is plausible that these species of iguana originated in Australia instead of the Americas, and journeyed from Australia to the discovered islands by other means.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The scientist's argument states that the species on the island rafted on floating debris from America. To weaken the argument, we need an option that proves the species did not come from America.
Option A talks about species not found in America, but this has nothing to do with the iguanas in question.
Option B states that the iguanas found on the island are different from those found in the Americas but it doesn't weaken the argument, it just gives additional information.
Option C talks about documented cases of iguanas rafting, but it doesn't weaken the argument either.
Option D provides evidence similar species found in Australia, which weakens the argument by suggesting the species could have reached the islands from Australia instead of from America.
Option E talks about other species but doesn't directly relate to the iguanas in question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The given argument suggests that the iguana species on these islands originated from the Americas and arrived on these islands via the Pacific Ocean.
  If there are iguana species on these islands that are not found in the Americas, then it would weaken the scientist's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that the iguanas on the islands rafted from the Americas, so an answer that outlines a different explanation will weaken the argument.
  Options A, B and D provide information that does not strengthen an alternative explanation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety based on studies from 30 years ago, even when using latest safety technology. 
  However, the editorialist doesn't acknowledge the possibility that the latest safety technology might have improved from 30 years ago. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The editorialist argues that increasing the air traffic would reduce safety based on 30-year-old studies even when the latest safety technology is used.
  The editorialist fails to consider other factors.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond airport's design capacity would decrease safety based on studies from 30 years ago.
  The council members who support the increase say that the latest safety technology would accompany any increase.
  The editorialist doesn't consider this possibility.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond an airport's original design capacity reduces safety.
  The editorialist fails to consider current safety technology and whether it has improved since the studies conducted 30 years ago.
  The correct choice will match the above reasoning.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The editorial claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity.
  It assumes that these studies generalize to the airport in question.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The editorialist provided evidence of multiple studies from 30 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the latest safety technology does not improve safety.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The editorialist claims that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's capacity will decrease safety.
  They support their claim by stating that studies 30 years ago demonstrate a similar trend.
  The council members claim that safety will not decrease because modern safety technology will be used.
  The editorialist does not consider the effect of modern technology or the knowledge of council members on the topic.
Action: Answer(B)
Response 7:
Thought: 
    The editorialist argues against the council members that increasing air traffic at airports beyond design capacity will decrease safety.
    The studies conducted 30 years ago support that conclusion.
    The council members argue that the latest safety technology will be purchased and therefore safety will increase.
    The editorialist argues that this increase would decrease safety based on past studies.
    Thus, the argument might contain a flaw.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The editorialist claims that safety would be reduced even with the latest safety technology.
  However, supporters claim that the latest safety technology will prevent safety reduction.
  The editorialist's argument is based on studies conducted 30 years ago.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The editorialist argues that allowing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety because of studies conducted 30 years ago
  Studies conducted 30 years ago might not reflect the current situation and technology

Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Anger is always expressible.
  B: Anger is a visceral emotion.
  C: Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express.
  D: All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral.
  E: An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument says that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  Therefore, the conclusion will follow logically if the answer choice supports the argument.
  If there is an assumption, the conclusion of the argument will be valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist concludes that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The premise is that there are situations in which any visceral emotion should be expressed.
  The answer choice, which the argument assumes, must link the premise and the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: The argument states that there are situations in which it is healthy to try to express any visceral emotion, and then concludes by specifically referring to anger. The assumed premise must support the idea that anger is indeed a visceral emotion and that all visceral emotions are healthy to express.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: The argument states that there is always a healthy situation to express one's anger. So, a possible assumption to the argument may be that anger is always expressible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that there are always situations to healthily express anger and back this claim by providing the premise that there are always situations to healthily express any visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist asserts that there are always healthy situations to express visceral emotions, including anger.
  The conclusion must assume that because anger is a visceral emotion, it is always healthy to try to express one's anger.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: The argument states that there are always healthy situations to express any visceral emotion, and then concludes that it is always healthy to express one's anger. Therefore, the assumption would be something that links and validates the conclusion, such as the relationship between anger as a visceral emotion and its always healthy expression.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger.
  The premise given is that any visceral emotion has situations in which its expression is healthy.
  The conclusion logically follows if we assume that anger is a visceral emotion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The psychiatrist's argument mentions that there are situations where it is healthy to express any visceral emotion and thus concludes that there are situations where it is healthy to express anger.
  The assumption on which the argument conclusion follows logically must be related to the above mention, relating to both the general concept of expressing emotions and the specific example of expressing anger.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions occur between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads having bicycle lanes than on roads without such lanes.
The statement is not convincing as it does not consider other factors such as the speed limit of certain roads, the behavior of drivers, etc.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
The argument presents statistics that appear to contradict the conclusion it reaches, which indicates a vulnerability.
The argument uses statistics to conclude that adding designated bicycle lanes to existing roads does not enhance the safety of bicyclists. 
It does not address factors that may impact the likelihood of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles in each type of road.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author argues that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads won't enhance bicyclists' safety 
  More collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads with bicycle lanes 
  The argument can be weaker if it neglects relevant arguments. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that adding designated bicycle lanes is unlikely to enhance bicycle safety.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism as it fails to consider another factor such as the behavior of motorists or the bicyclists themselves.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument's claim that adding bike lanes to roads will not enhance the safety of bicyclists seems to be too absolute based on the statistics given.
  The fact that adding bike lanes doesn't reduce the incidence of accidents on bike lanes is not directly connected to the claim that it won't improve safety.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that the statistics on collision between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with designated bicycle lanes do not support the notion that adding such lanes to roads improves safety for bicyclists.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism that it overlooks some aspect that may impact the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument assumes that having bicycle lanes on roads is the chief factor responsible for greater number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles without considering other factors that may contribute to the increase in accidents.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument offers evidence regarding the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with designated bike lanes. Based on this evidence, it draws a conclusion that adding bike lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists. 
It might overlook other possibilities that might enhance the safety of bicyclists but aren't part of this evidence.

Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above?
Choices:
  A: Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
  B: Some flowers rely on insects other than bees.
  C: The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees.
  D: Many nonflowering plants rely on bees.
  E: Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The question stem presents a statement and asks us to choose an answer choice that supports it.
  The statement is suggesting that bee's vision is a catalyst for the evolution of flowers and not the other way around.
  We're looking for an answer that strengthens this claim.
  Options A, B, C, and D do not provide support to the given statement. 
  Option E is irrelevant in supporting the claim. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The statement claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  To support this, the correct option should show that bees’ color vision plays a role in the evolution of flowers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question stem presents an argument, which we must support.
  A, B and D either don't say anything about the relationship between flowers and bees or, if they do, they can be interpreted in a way that weakens the argument.
  C is irrelevant.
  E pulls the argument in the other direction entirely. If anything, it weakens rather than strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("A") - Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The statement suggests that flowers developed in response to the vision that bees have.
  So, the choice that supports this statement would show that the advantage of flower color is mostly for the attraction of bees.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question is asking for the answer that best supports the statement which suggests that flowers developed in response to bees' vision.
  A, B, C and D do not relate to the statement.
  If E is true, it is likely that flowers developed traits that attract bees.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The statement posits that flowers developed in response to bees’ vision, rather than vice versa. 
  We need the option that supports this claim. 
  Out of the given options, option (A) seems to be the most suitable one. If other insects don’t depend on perceiving colors despite having a similar vision to bees, this could mean that flowers didn't evolve color solely so that bees would be attracted to them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The statement above claims that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have.
  We need to find an option that supports this claim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question is asking us for the choice that supports the idea that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color.
  We need to choose an option that suggests that the selection of a particular color was not the driving force of developing flowers. 
  Option (C) seems to be irrelevant to the discussion. The focus is not on the number of species of flowers or bees.  
  Option (D) talks about how plants rely on bees which is also irrelevant to the discussion.
  Option (E) may not support the initial statement because it is considered that flowers evolved to take advantage of bees' need for nectar as a food source.
  Option (A) could indicate that different insects may use the same type of vision bees use, and the reason behind the development of a particular coloration can be better explained by factors that are common to those insects.
  Option (B) suggests that flowers can exist without bees, thus reinforcing the idea that flower coloration might not solely be due to the need to attract bees. 
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents a conflict between a healthier choice and environmental preservation.
  The healthier choice may lead to species extinction if universally adopted.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that a diet that is healthy for humans would be unsustainable for the planet (marine species would become extinct), so it should not be universally adopted.
  It is similar to argument C, which states that a spending pattern that is good for individuals would be disastrous for the economy if everyone adopted it, so it should not be recommended for everyone.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet would result in the eventual extinction of marine species.
A similar situation could be one where a desired action may have negative outcomes that make it impossible to pursue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument talks about a diet that is healthier but the universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The argument suggests that a trade-off exists between the introduction of a healthier diet and preserving marine species.
  We need to identify an argument in which there is a tradeoff or a dilemma between two desirable outcomes.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
 The argument suggests that adopting a diet with protein from fish which is healthier than red meat will lead to the extinction of marine species, making the diet impossible.
It then argues that universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument provides a case where a desirable outcome, universal adoption of a fish-based diet, would lead to the undesirable outcome of endangering marine species.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The argument talks about a healthier diet that if adopted universally, would lead to the extinction of the marine species that make it up. It concludes that such a diet should not be recommended. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument posits that adopting a healthier diet that is based on fish protein would result in the extinction of marine species on which the diet is based.
  Thus, universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
  The similar reasoning can be seen in the option:
    A: Conclusively establishing the safety of vitamin E supplements is necessary before recommending that everyone takes it every day.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:  
  The argument presents a dilemma between the health benefits of a fish-based diet and the environmental harm it would cause if universally adopted.
  The dilemma presented in option (C) can be likened to the above argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument mentions that a diet with fish protein is much healthier but not sustainable.
  For this reason, recommending that everyone adopt this diet is not a good option.
  A similar reasoning is also presented in one of the answer choices.
  Option C seems to have a relationship with economic well-being rather than health but also presents a tradeoff.
  Comparing the options, it seems B and E do not match the reasoning in the argument.
  A and C seem to present a tradeoff when extending something that has clear evidence of being beneficial.
  However, C may not be as parallel to the argument, as it does not mention health.

But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought:
The employee argues that blocking access to non-work-related websites is not a reasonable solution to avoiding distractions at work and uses the example of offices that have windows or are nicely decorated to illustrate the point. 
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning:
Choice D argues against the notion that creating compelling characters in a novel is the panacea to selling novels. Different elements ("other elements") apart from character creation contribute to the development and sale of a manuscript. Similarly, in the employee's argument, blocking non-work-related websites does not guarantee a distraction-free work environment.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that a pleasant office environment can be just as distracting, yet no one is trying to strip the decoration or windows from the office. 
  This would be similar to an argument in which a factor is being singled out as harmful without considering other factors that could be just as harmful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that distractions are not always attributable to websites and that other distractions like offices with windows or decorations can also hinder employees. 
  Option (D) also argues against thinking about a particular factor in isolation, suggesting that publishers and agents might reject books that put too much emphasis on character development at the expense of other aspects.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The employee is arguing that blocking non-work-related websites is not the solution to keeping employees focused because other office features such as a window or decor could also be distracting.
  Choice A argues that moderation does not take into account biological differences. 
  Choice B argues that not all chemicals that cause cancer are banned.
  Choice C argues that Acme needs to hire about 1,000 people because 1,000 are retiring.
  Choice D argues that engaging characters do not guarantee a manuscript will be published.
  Choice E argues that judging a movie's success solely on profit is misguided.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
 The employee argues that the company's intervention is unjustified because there are other types of distractions not being addressed.
Option D is talking about an argument that does not necessarily have causality, and publishers are given as example to argue that a certain feature does not ensure success.
Option A talks about differences between individuals and that talk of moderation overlooks that point.
Option E argues that the criteria of success for movies is flawed.
Option C argues that a future necessity will arise and that a certain number of employees will be required to meet the demand.
Action: Answer("D")  
Response 5:
Thought: 
The employee argues that website filtering software may be ineffective because being distracted at work is not solely related to access to non-work-related websites.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The employee argues that just as some offices with windows or decorations can be distracting yet no one claims that undecorated, windowless offices are necessary for best work, website blocking software may not be necessary for the same reason.
  Choice D argues that emphasizing engaging characters does not guarantee a sale, yet manuscripts that do not prioritize character still do not sell.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The employee argues that website filtering software can be as distracting as things like having a window or decoration. It is not fair to assume blanket rules to eliminate distractions. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The employee is arguing that the company's reasoning for website filtering software is flawed, as it does not take into account that other factors that distract workers are not filtered. 
  Choice D seems similar in that it argues against a one-sided statement as a way to prove a point.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The employee is arguing that, just like windowless and undecorated rooms aren't the only things that lead to distractions, access to non-work-related websites also does not distract employees to the point where they cannot do their best work.

Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The study revealed that the nicotine levels in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are the same, no matter the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
  We need to know why the level of nicotine in the blood is the same, regardless of the nicotine level in cigarettes.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The study found that regardless of smoking low or high nicotine cigarettes, the level of nicotine in the blood of smokers remains identical at the end of the day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The study found that nicotine absorption rates are the same at the end of the day regardless of nicotine levels in cigarettes.
  We need to find an answer that helps explain why nicotine absorption rates could stay consistent even if the levels of nicotine in cigarettes are not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The study found identical levels of nicotine measured in the blood of smokers regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoked.
  We need to find the option that explains why the nicotine level is the same irrespective of the level of nicotine in cigarettes.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The study found that a one-pack-per-day smoker will have the same nicotine levels in their blood, regardless of the nicotine level of the cigarette they smoke.
  To explain why this is so, we must find a choice that best explains how the body processes nicotine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The study shows that smoking low and high nicotine cigarettes has no significant effect on the nicotine levels in the smoker's blood.
  To explain this finding, we need to explore how nicotine acts in the human body.
  Option A is possible, but it's too extreme to assume that the body can only absorb a specific amount of nicotine.
  Option B doesn't directly address the finding of the study.
  Option C is a possibility since it could explain why nicotine levels do get equalized by the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  Option D is irrelevant to the finding of the study since it refers to tar levels, not nicotine levels.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the finding of the study.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The nicotine study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  We need an explanation or cause that most helps to support the finding.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 7:
Thought:
  The study revealed that levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers after smoking a pack of either low or high-nicotine cigarettes are the same.
  The question asks for the choice that most helps to explain the findings of the nicotine study.
  Option A does not explain the findings.
  Option B is discussing smoking behaviors, which is irrelevant.
  Option D talks about tar levels and is irrelevant.
  Option E is not relevant to explaining the findings of the study.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The nicotine study found that smokers had the same levels of nicotine in their blood at the end of the day regardless of the cigarettes they smoked.
  We need an option that explains how the same amount of nicotine ends up in the blood, even when smoking cigarettes with different nicotine levels.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The study shows that the level of nicotine found in the blood of smokers is identical irrespective of low-or high-nicotine cigarettes they smoke. The question asks to choose the option that explains the finding of the study.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation:
  Option C explains the study's findings that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This explanation shows that smokers may adjust how much nicotine they get from each cigarette by smoking more cigarettes if the nicotine content is low, balancing the total amount of nicotine for the day.

Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef.
  B: The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread.
  C: The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
  D: Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain.
  E: The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes that when grain prices double, bread prices increase by 10-15% and grain-fed beef prices double.
  We need to find the reason that supports this phenomenon. 
  Option B might not work as it shares information about the existing difference in the price of bread and beef.
  Option A, C, D, and E might explain the phenomenon's reasons. 
  Option D (information about grass-fed cattle) seems like it is not contributing much to the phenomenon's explanation. 
  It seems Option A and E are also not suitable options for this question. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If grain prices double, the cost of producing beef also doubles, leading to an increase in the price of beef.
  However, due to the difference in labor and marketing costs between producing bread and beef, the rise in price for bread is only between 10-15%.
  Therefore, the information needed would be about the cost differences in producing bread and beef.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The prompt states that bread prices will rise between 10 and 15 percent if grain prices double.
  The prompt also states that the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  Thus, the phenomenon described above is primarily a result of an increase in the cost of grain feed.
  We need to identify the option that will most contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The phenomenon shows bread and beef prices react differently when grain prices change.
  To explain, we need to find the most relevant difference between the two.
  One possible difference is the cost structure, which implies one option can be correct.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that the price of grain-fed beef nearly doubles, while the price of a loaf of bread increases between 10-15%.
  To explain this, we need to look for an option that could address the cause of the difference in price hike.
  Option A is not relevant.
  Option B is also not related to the phenomenon.
  Cost goes into making bread and beef, but option C only provides information about the types of costs, not a relevant factor that could link the difference in price increase.
  Option D provides the essential information that the majority of beef sold comes from grain-fed cattle, and thus the hike in grain price directly leads to the rise in beef price.
  Option E is not helpful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The phenomenon is that the price of grain-fed beef will almost double if grain prices double, while the price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 to 15 percent.
  We need to find an answer that explains this phenomenon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The phenomenon described is that raising the price of grain causes bread price to increase between 10 and 15 percent, while beef price almost doubles.
  We need to find an explanation that supports this phenomenon.
  Option C may contribute to an explanation as it implies that the increase in grain cost that comes with making beef will have a much larger effect on the cost of producing beef than the increase in grain cost will have on the cost of producing bread.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The stimulus tells us that the price rise of bread is between 10 and 15 percent whereas in grain-fed beef, it is close to doubling. 
  To explain why the price of beef is doubling, we need to know something that is unique to beef production and not applicable to bread production.
  Options A, B, C, and E do not provide compelling reasons for the price difference.
  Option D seems like it could be an explanation for the rise in meat prices since there could be a shortage in the production of grain-fed beef due to scarcity or other factors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The phenomenon described is that grain-fed beef doubles in price and the price of bread rises between 10 and 15 percent when grain prices double.
  We need to identify the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon.
  Option A is irrelevant.
  Option B discusses the price difference between beef and bread, but does not explain why grain-fed beef doubles in price and why bread prices rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Option C may be plausible, but does not explain why grain-fed beef doubles in price more than bread.
  Option D is relevant because it suggests that there is a higher demand for grain-fed beef, causing its price to double, while grass-fed beef is not a popular choice. However, it does not explain why bread prices also rise between 10 and 15 percent.
  Option E is irrelevant.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The phenomenon described is that grain-fed beef will come close to doubling and the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent when grain prices double. 
  The question asks for an explanation of this phenomenon.
  From the answer choices, C seems to be closest in providing an explanation of the phenomenon as it says that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef while the labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost.

Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.
  C: Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal.
  D: Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories.
  E: Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
Response 0:

However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.

Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that H pylori cannot be a commensal bacterium since it causes stomach ulcers in some people even though it also strengthens immune response. 
  However, the argument fails to acknowledge the fact that M tuberculosis, a bacterium that does not benefit its host, hardly causes tuberculosis in people who have it. 
  Therefore, if there were a common factor between H pylori and M tuberculosis that justifies why some people get sick from one bacterium while others do not, it would undermine reasons for ruling out H pylori as a commensal.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is discussing two types of bacteria, H. pylori and M. tuberculosis, and how they are perceived as either commensal or pathogenic based on the prevalence of disease occurring due to their presence. In order to undermine the argument's reasoning, we should examine the statement expressing H. pylori as commensal and provide evidence against this. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it while M tuberculosis is not a commensal because only about 10% of the people who harbor it get sick. We need to find a statement that shows the flaw in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori is not a commensal, despite purportedly strengthening immune responses.
  The argument contrasts H pylori with M tuberculosis, which does not confer such benefits.
  To undermine the reasoning, we need to challenge how the two examples are being compared.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that some scientists wrongly refer to H pylori as a commensal because it only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of those it inhabits. The argument then compares this to M tuberculosis, which only causes sickness in about 10% of those it inhabits but is not referred to as a commensal. 
Action: Answer("C") 
  Explanation: Answer choice (C) asserts that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. This undermines the argument's reasoning because the argument concludes that H pylori is not a commensal because it causes ulcers, and that only 10% of people with M tuberculosis become ill so it cannot be classified as a commensal either. However, if people cannot derive any benefit from the presence of M tuberculosis, then it cannot be compared to H pylori. Choice (A) is irrelevant, (B) already mentions that tuberculosis lasts longer, (D) is not relevant to the argument, and (E) is already mentioned in the prompt and does not affect the argument's reasoning.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune system, based on the fact that only a small percentage of people get stomach ulcers from it. The argument discredits the notion that low pathogenicity makes a bacterium a commensal by pointing out that only a small percentage of people get sick from M tuberculosis, but no one would consider it a commensal.
  
  Therefore, the answer choice that will most undermine the argument's reasoning is the one that challenges the similarities/differences between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B undermines the argument that the only reason Helicobacter pylori can be classified as a commensal is that it does not cause disease in the vast majority of those who carry it by highlighting a potentially significant difference between the course of illnesses caused by the two bacteria.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that considering H pylori a commensal bacterium is misguided, and it uses M tuberculosis as an example.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to point out a difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis that undermines the argument's comparison.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because not all people who harbor it get sick, and the same can be said for M tuberculosis. We need to look for a statement that challenges the basis of the argument.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought:
The argument claims that Helicobacter pylori is not a commensal despite strengthening immune responses, because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, whereas many who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis don't get sick from it. We need to find a statement that undermines the argument.
Option A does not affect the reasoning regarding whether H. pylori and M. tuberculosis bacteria are commensals or not.
Option B provides information but does not necessarily undermine the argument.
Option C is directly relevant and goes against the argument. If there is no benefit of having M. tuberculosis in one's body, but there are benefits to having H. pylori, then it is more likely that H. pylori could be considered a commensal.
Option D provides more information but it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
Option E provides more information but it does not necessarily weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument's reasoning is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal just because it only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10 percent of people, unlike M tuberculosis that can cause tuberculosis in only 10 percent of people but is not considered a commensal.
  If something undermines this reasoning, then it would weaken the argument's validity.

Context: Principle: Any person or business knowingly aiding someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement. Application: Grandview Department Store, which features a self-service photo-printing kiosk, is guilty of copyright infringement since a customer using the kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright by printing photographs whose copyright is held by the photographer.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the application of the principle?
Choices:
  A: The operator of a business has the same legal obligations to customers who use self-service facilities as it has to customers who use full-service facilities.
  B: The management of a business that is open to the public is obligated to report to the authorities any illegal activity that it witnesses on its property.
  C: The owner of a self-service printing kiosk should post a notice advising customers that copyrighted material should not be printed at the kiosk without the permission of the copyright holder.
  D: Owners of self-service facilities should monitor those facilities in order to ensure that they are not used for illegal or unethical purposes.

Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is regarding the navigation ability of polar bears.
  Naturalists claim that they can navigate over long distances.
  Evidence is presented to support the claim.
  We need to find an option that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  If the evidence is not valid, the claim may not hold.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- We want to find the choice which would weaken the naturalists' claim with respect to polar bears' navigation abilities.
- The evidence provided is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
- We need to identify information that weakens the validity of this evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation:
- If the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, it could indicate that the bear was already oriented in the general direction of its home territory and did not need to rely on its navigation abilities to find its way back.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The naturalists are claiming that the polar bear's ability to navigate over considerable distances is evidence.
  Something that undermines this evidence could weaken the claim of naturalists.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks for the option which "casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence" in support of the naturalists' claim.
  The evidence is that a polar bear found its way home from 500 kilometers away.

Action: Answer("B")  
  Option B undermines the evidence offered by the naturalists. If the polar bear was released on its annual migration route, it suggests that the bear found its way home by following a familiar path rather than navigating based on memory.
Response 4:
Thought:
  To weaken the naturalists' claim;
  Find an answer that implies the return of the polar bear being due to factors other than navigation;
  An option that implies that the bear found its way due to luck or a random occurrence could cast the most doubt on the naturalists' claim.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question asks for the answer that casts the most doubt on the validity of the polar bear's navigational ability.
  If the polar bear was able to detect familiar smells from a distance, release location on an annual migration route may not be significant, and wandering off course would not necessarily counter the evidence in question.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The evidence offered is that a polar bear returned to its home territory successfully after being released over 500 kilometers away. 
  If the answer indicates a reason to doubt the validity of the evidence, it means the naturalists' claim may not be true.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 7:
Thought:
  The evidence is that a polar bear found its way back to its home territory over a long distance.
  We need to find an answer choice that casts doubt on this evidence.
  If the answer choice explains how the polar bear could have found its way back without navigation abilities, it would cast doubt on the evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks about the choice that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  The evidence presented is that a polar bear, released 500 kilometers (300 miles) away, returned to its home territory.
  We need to select the choice that weakens the strength of this evidence the most.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim polar bears have navigation abilities.
  The evidence for this claim is a polar bear returning home from 500km away.
  The question asks for what would weaken the evidence.
  If there is certain information making the bear's return plausible, that would weaken the evidence.

Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that fther deficiency is a cause for colon cancer and fther-rich foods help prevent it.
  We need to find an option which weakens the claim.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it. 
  We need to find an option that shows some other factors apart from the consumption of fiber, which can cause colon cancer or can prevent it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that insufficient fther causes colon cancer and sufficient fther prevents it.
  The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism means we need to find a gap or flaw in the argument, which would render it weak or incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  The argument also supports its claims by discussing how colon cancer rates are higher in countries with lower consumption of fiber.
  The argument may be vulnerable to a claim that high-fiber diets do not cause any significant differences in colon cancer rates.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The argument asserts that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
  Therefore, the argument overlooks the possibility that another factor might explain the negative correlation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer. 
  The argument uses evidence to support the causal relationship. 
  The question asks for a criticism that the argument overlooks.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument provides evidence which suggests that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption prevents it.
  To criticize this argument, we need to identify an issue with evidence or consider other possible factors.
  Choice A, B and C do not argue against the given evidence and conclusion.
  Choice D is partly true but not strong enough to criticize the argument.
  Choice E may suggest that other substances present in the fiber-rich diet could also be a contributing factor in preventing colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that a negative correlation exists between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument assumes that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption prevents it.
  We need to find a flaw in the argument that the given evidence does not support this conclusion.
  Evaluating each option:
    A - consumption of the fiber is rising in many countries does not affect the argument's conclusion in either direction.
    B - Even if high-fiber reduces the risk of many types of cancer, it does not affect the argument's conclusion in regards to colon cancer.
    C - Difficulty including fiber in one's diet does not affect the argument's premise that fiber is necessary to prevent colon cancer.
    D - The distinction that different foods with fiber have different cancer-fighting properties does not change the argument's conclusion.
    E - Foods containing fiber also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer is not a direct refutation of the conclusion that fiber itself prevents colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it, but the argument fails to consider other possibilities.
  Option A is irrelevant as the argument intended to explain the relation between low fther diets and colon cancer.
  Option B doesn't address the conclusion the argument has made.

Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Response 0:

  The journalist has not shown why Bruch Industries would not be listed on the document if it were a member of the trade group.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:
The flaw in the journalist's reasoning is that they assume that the document is a comprehensive list of all the manufacturing companies that belong to the trade group without presenting any evidence to support this claim. Thus, the argument can be weakened by providing evidence that suggests some companies who are members of the trade group might not be on this list. Answer B addresses this flaw by pointing out the lack of evidence to support the claim that the document names every member of the trade group.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The journalist assumes that the document naming members of the trade group is comprehensive and all-inclusive.
  That assumption may be incorrect.
  It's possible that some members, like Bruch Industries, asked that their names be withheld from the list.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The journalist assumes that every member of the trade group is listed in the document.
  The journalist uses this assumption to conclude that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group.

  The journalist assumes that Bruch Industries is not a member because it is not listed.
  The journalist assumes that the document is secret and is accidentally sent to the journalist.
  The journalist assumes that Bruch Industries doesn't want their membership to be known.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thoughts: 
  The journalist concludes that Bruch Industries is not a member because it is not mentioned in the document that lists hundreds of members.
  The journalist is assuming that the document lists all members of the trade group.
  There could be other reasons why Bruch Industries is not in the document (e.g. they were removed, it was an old document).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("B") 

The journalist's reasoning is flawed because he/she assumes that the document lists every manufacturing company in the trade group, but the document may be incomplete and doesn't present evidence that all the members are present in it. Therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group just because they are not on the list, may not be valid.

Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The statement presents an apparent discrepancy that leatherbacks living in the wild or in captivity are exposed to different fatal diseases, but their theoretical life expectancy is the same.
  A new piece of information that explains how the same life expectancy can be true for both leatherbacks living in the wild or in captivity, despite being exposed to different fatal diseases should be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks for the option that helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks subject to captivity are vulnerable to many fatal diseases that those living in the wild would never encounter, yet both have the same theoretical maximum life expectancy.
  We need to identify an option that explains why the life expectancy is the same.
Action: Answer("E")  
Option E explains that the size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age, which means that leatherbacks in captivity may not be as old as we tend to believe them to be. That explains why the theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether in captivity or the wild.
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the leatherback reaches its theoretical maximum life expectancy, then it must not matter if it is in captivity or the wild.
  There is an apparent discrepancy between the fatal disease in captivity and the life expectancy of the leatherbacks.
Action: Answer("E")  
  The size of a leatherback is not an indication of its age. Therefore, it would be difficult to compare the lifespan of wild and captive leatherbacks based solely on its size, since a larger captive leatherback may have lived for many years while a smaller wild leatherback may have lived longer.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument asserts that leatherbacks are susceptible to more diseases in captivity than in the wild, yet they have similar life expectancies.
  Therefore, it is likely that the diseases that attack the Leatherbacks in the wild are more likely to kill them than the diseases contracted when in captivity.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that despite exposure to fatal diseases in captivity, leatherback turtles can reach their maximum life expectancy with the same likelihood as those in the wild.
  The question is asking for information that helps to resolve the discrepancy.
  The correct answer will explain how leatherbacks in captivity are not subject to the same factors that make them vulnerable to disease in the wild.
Action: Answer("C")  
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question is asking for a statement that resolves the apparent discrepancy between the fact that leatherbacks in captivity are prone to fatal diseases and yet still have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To solve this, we should look for an answer that connects these two facts.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument states a surprising finding that despite higher risk of fatal diseases in captivity, leatherbacks reach their max life in captivity. I need to find an option that resolves this paradoxical situation. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
Option C stating the fact that most leatherbacks that die in the wild are killed by predators resolves the paradoxical situation. This means that leatherbacks would have the opportunity to live longer in captivity than in the wild.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The statement says that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have a similar likelihood of reaching their maximum age expectancy, which means there is not much difference between being in captivity or the wild.
  We need to find out what could explain why the diseases could reduce their lifespan in captivity but still live to their maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
  Option (C) is the best answer because it suggests that the major cause of death of leatherbacks in the wild is not diseases, but predators. This means that diseases are not a significant factor in the reduction of lifespan in the wild, and therefore, it would explain why they can still reach their maximum age expectancy even though they are prey to predators. In captivity, even though they are not exposed to predators, they are susceptible to diseases, reducing their lifespan and explain the apparent discrepancy.
Response 8:
Thought:
The argument tells us that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, yet they have a similar likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy whether in captivity or in the wild. To resolve this discrepancy, we need an option that explains why the likelihood is not significantly affected by whether they are in captivity or in the wild.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
Option E provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching the theoretical maximum life expectancy is independent of whether leatherbacks are captive or in the wild—because size is not a trustworthy indicator of their age. Thus, despite being susceptible to fatal illnesses in captivity, if the leatherback cannot be determined as aging slowly, the same probability of attaining maximum life expectancy in the wild applies, making the statement in the argument true.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that it is surprising that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild, given that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to various fatal diseases whereas leatherbacks in the wild do not have these risks. 
  The correct answer should help explain the discrepancy presented.

Topic: Law
Context: It is likely that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled. Most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership. Furthermore, their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: Wilke & Wilke have produced more new shows for this season than they produced last season.
  B: Most of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year were police dramas.
  C: None of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were not canceled were police dramas.
  D: All of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas.
  E: None of the most popular television shows last year were police dramas.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument claims that most of the new Wilke & Wilke shows will probably be canceled due to insufficient viewership. To strengthen the argument, we need a statement that further implies that it is not likely that police dramas would be successful this season. 
  (A) does not provide information about the nature of the new shows or the popularity of police dramas, so it cannot strengthen the argument. 
  (B) suggests that the production company has a history of producing police dramas, but it does not give any reason why those productions would continue to fail. 
  (C) does not provide any information about their new productions, so it does not help us reason about whether the new shows will be successful. 
  (D) helps to confirm the hypothesis that police dramas are unpopular as all of their new shows that were canceled last season were police dramas themselves. 
  (E) helps to support the argument against police dramas because it suggests that no police drama was popular even last year. 
  Therefore, Option (E) is the most appropriate answer choice as it supports the argument against police dramas. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument says that the new police dramas produced by Wilke & Wilke might fail due to low viewership.
  We need to find an option that supports the fact that police dramas are not popular.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is that it's likely that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled due to insufficient viewership.
  The reason was that most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership and few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that makes the likelihood of cancellation higher.
Action: Answer("D") 
Reasoning: 
  Option D strengthens the argument the most by providing evidence that all of the new shows produced last year by Wilke & Wilke, which were canceled, were police dramas. Hence, it reinforces the claim that Wilke & Wilke's police dramas were not popular last year, thereby making it more likely that their new programs will suffer the same consequence.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that most of the new shows produced for this season by Wilke & Wilke will be canceled due to past experience and the nature of their new shows.
  To strengthen the argument, we need an option that reinforces one of these reasoning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that Wilke & Wilke's new police dramas may be unsuccessful due to historical trends. 
  Thus, a statement that strengthens the position that police dramas are unlikely to succeed would most bolster the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that new programs produced by Wilke and Wilke are likely to be canceled because the previous new shows were canceled, and it points out that their new shows are police dramas, which have been unpopular recently.
  To strengthen this argument, we need additional information that supports that police dramas are not the kind of shows that people watch in large numbers or that the past performance of Wilke & Wilke in making dramas is not exceptional.
  Option D provides evidence that all new shows produced by Wilke & Wilke that were canceled last year were police dramas, indicating that the recent trend of police dramas not being popular affecting Wilke & Wilke in the past year. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that Wilke & Wilke's new police dramas are not likely to be popular.
  We need an option that supports this contention.
  The option that mentions a lack of previous popularity for police dramas helps to strengthen this argument.
Action: Answer("E")  
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that new shows produced by Wilke & Wilke will be canceled due to insufficient viewership.
  The argument also suggests that few police dramas have been popular in recent years.
  Therefore, a statement that connects the new police dramas produced by Wilke & Wilke to the trend of unpopular police dramas might help to strengthen the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument is that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produced for this season will be canceled because their shows last year were canceled due to insufficient viewership.
  The argument also implies that police dramas have been unpopular in recent years; thus, their new police dramas are unlikely to be successful.
  To strengthen the argument, we need a statement that supports their reasoning or implies that the new police dramas will be unsuccessful.
  Option B implies that the majority of Wilke & Wilke's unsuccessful shows last season were police dramas, which reinforces their concern.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
The argument states that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produced for this season will be canceled due to insufficient viewership, and most of the new shows they produced last season were also canceled due to insufficient viewership. Furthermore, few police dramas have been popular in recent years. 
So, in order to strengthen the argument, the option should provide additional evidence to support the idea that new police dramas will not be popular this season and shows produced by Wilke & Wilke will not be an exception. 

Action: Answer("E") 

Explanation: 
Option E states that none of the popular shows last year was police dramas. This strengthens the statement that people in recent times have not been enjoying police dramas, thereby strengthening the argument that new police dramas might not be popular this season.

Topic: Law
Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
  B: People are often reluctant to take on new challenges.
  C: Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers.
  D: People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations.
  E: People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that social inertia is the main determinant of human behavior when it comes to resisting technological innovations.
  We need to pick an option that cast doubts on this assumption.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety, based on the idea that people resist technological innovations that could improve their working conditions.
  We need to find a choice that suggests that people are not inherently resistant to technological innovations.
Action: Answer("C")

Response 4:
Thought:
The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety based on history of technological innovations. I need to select an option that contradicts this conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
Option C, which states that some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, contradicts the conclusion that social inertia is the most powerful determinant of human behavior with respect to new technologies. The fact that some innovations have been enthusiastically adopted suggests that people can indeed be motivated to embrace new technologies.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that social inertia is more powerful than the desire for comfort or safety, and provides evidence to support this claim by citing examples of resistance to technological innovation.
  We are looking for an answer choice that contradicts or weakens the evidence presented in the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is the main driver of human behavior rather than the desire for comfort or safety.
  To undermine this, we need to show that people's behavior is more influenced by their desire for comfort and safety.
  Choice C can do this by providing an example of technological innovation that workers embrace.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  The argument claims that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than desire for comfort or safety. If some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers, then the argument's claim is weakened, as it would suggest that desire for comfort or safety can override social inertia in some cases. None of the other answer choices directly attack the argument's claim.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that social inertia is stronger than the desire for comfort or safety. 
  Therefore, to undermine the reasoning, we need evidence that shows the desire for comfort or safety plays a more significant role.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument is that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety because history shows that people strongly resisted technological innovations even when those innovations would have made their working conditions more comfortable or safe.

Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is that Harrold Foods dominates the market now and only needs to maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
  The premise is that 72% of all consumers think that "Hero" already dominates the market. However, Harrold Foods needs to maintain a market share of more than 50% to be dominant.
  The argument mistakenly takes the condition of being perceived as dominating the market by consumers to be sufficient for Harrold Foods to actually dominate the market. This is an error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is concluding that Harrold Food dominates the soft drink market and would continue to do so, based on the result of a survey that shows 72% of consumers think that "Hero" dominates the market.
  The survey that was conducted in the past may not necessarily hold true for the future.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The argument states that since "Hero" already dominates the market, then "Hero" need only maintain its current market share in order to continue doing so. The assertion completely ignores consideration of other drinks that may come into the market in the future. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author argues that Harrold Foods dominates the market since "Hero" is the most popular carbonated drink product in the market.
  Although the evidence shows that "Hero" is already dominant before the new advertising campaign, which is not a guarantee for the future.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of thinking that the evidence of current state should also be true in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that "Hero" already dominates the market because in the opinion of 72% of all consumers it dominates the market.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument says that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market, and any product with more than 50% of the sales in the market is dominant.
  However, just because most consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market does not guarantee that sales figures actually support this claim.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the idea that "Hero" already dominates the soft-drink market, and thus Harrold Foods need only maintain its current market share.
  This conclusion is based on a flawed interpretation of the survey results.
  Even if 72 percent of all consumers think that "Hero" dominates the market, this does not necessarily mean that "Hero" has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market despite its promotion campaign being redundant.
  This reasoning implies that Harrold Foods has more than 50 percent of the sales in the market, which could be untrue.
  Therefore, the argument may be mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument is concluding that Harrold Foods dominates the market because they already have 72% of the consumers' votes, which is more than 50%.
  This argument is committing an error in reasoning.

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.

The journalist states that all stars as massive as the Sun or greater have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Similarly, he states that stars less massive than the sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed and consumed. He also states that a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and this is why it cannot consume lithium. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The statements provide information about lithium in celestial objects and how it relates to their mass and nuclear furnace.
  Option A is incorrect because brown dwarfs do not have any lithium in their atmosphere.
  Option B is incorrect because it only applies to stars at least as massive as the Sun.
  Option C may be incorrect because some other objects could potentially have no lithium in their atmosphere.
  Option D is incorrect because some stars with less mass than the Sun may still have lithium in their atmosphere if the mixing of elements was incomplete.

  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
  Lithium is present in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs but not in stars with less mass than the Sun because the lithium is fully mixed and consumed inside the stars while a brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace to consume it.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The prediction is that sales of the game will exceed expectations soon. We need to find an option that suggests a trend that supports this prediction.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need an option that supports this prediction.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, it implies that the game is engrossing enough to keep the players interested over an extended period. This would support the prediction that the sales will soon exceed expectations.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The publisher is predicting that the sales of the game will also exceed expectations. 
  The game can be rented for two-day intervals and the publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Justification: 
  Option B justifies the publisher's prediction because the game takes several weeks to complete. If the game takes longer to complete, most renters may purchase the game as the cost of repeatedly renting the game will be higher than purchasing it. Also, if the game has a compelling plot and inventive puzzles, people may like to play the game again and again, which will eventually increase the sales.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The prediction is that sales will soon exceed expectations.
  The rental of the game is exceeding expectations, and there is an incentive to purchase the game after renting it.
  We need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the rental of the game will lead to increased purchases of the game.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Answer choice B supports the prediction that sales will soon exceed expectations. If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then they may rent the game multiple times before finishing it. Since rental rewards customers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental if they go on to purchase the game, they may be more inclined to do so instead of paying for several rentals.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  Publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Most people who rent the game buy it later and get a rebate equal to the rental cost.
Action: Answer("B")  
Justification: The fact that "It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game" best justifies the prediction, as the majority of players who rent may also purchase the game to take advantage of the rebate, meaning that the sales can significantly increase in due course.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The game being rented for two-day intervals indicates many people are engaged in playing it.
  The rebate for renters who go on to purchase the game would encourage renting.
  The publisher expects that sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this, we need to provide a factor that will contribute to an increase in sales.
Action: Answer("B") 
Justification: 
  The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game would mean that more people will opt to purchase the game instead of renting it multiple times, and they are more likely to take advantage of the rebate for renters who go on to purchase the game. This is likely to result in increased sales as the number of purchases of the game rise.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher believes that sales will soon exceed expectations because rentals are already exceeding expectations. 
  In order to justify this, we need information about the relationship between rentals and sales.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
  Option B explains that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game. This indicates that the game's renters will need to rent the game many times before they can complete it. As a result, renters may eventually decide to purchase the game to save money. This suggests that rental activity could lead to more sales. Therefore, the option B best justifies the publisher's prediction.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The predictions are about sales of the game, not rentals, so we need to find an option that suggest people will buy the game in retail outlets.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that sales of the game will exceed expectations soon.
  Rental of the game is exceeding expectations.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who purchase the game.
  The factor that helps the publisher to believe that the sales of the game will exceed expectations soon must relate to rentals or rebates.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then the renters are more likely to purchase the game because continuing to rent the game could be more expensive. Additionally, the publisher's rebate applied to one rental would provide almost the same benefits as purchasing the game. So most renters could be motivated to purchase the game after renting it a few times, increasing the publisher's sales.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The publisher's prediction is that sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find out which option strengthens that prediction.
Action: Answer("B")  
Reasoning: 
  The fact that the game takes several weeks for most players to complete suggests that those who have purchased the game probably plan to spend more time completing it than those who have rented it. Therefore, the percentage of people who follow through with the purchase after renting might be high. This would increase the likelihood that sales of the game will exceed expectations.

Topic: Law
Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.
  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument involves an "if ... then" statement that is claimed to be true.
  The support used is the outcome is contrary to the expected outcome of the initial statement.
  The flaw is in assuming that the outcome proves the initial statement false.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that the inflation rate would have lessened considerably if the party's economic theories were sound and it implemented its program. Because the inflation rate increased instead, it concludes the economic theories were far off the mark. 
  The argument assumes an either/or scenario in which there could be only one possibility. This flawed reasoning resembles which of the given arguments?
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a hypothetical situation that did not occur, and then concludes that the party's economic theories were wrong because the actual outcome was opposite to what was predicted.
  Option C presents a similar flawed reasoning by attributing a cause-effect relationship between two events that may not be related.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument presents a condition (successful implementation of party's program) and a hypothetical result (significant reduction in inflation), followed by a statement of what actually happened (actual increase in inflation). Then, it concludes that the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice (C) presents a similar reasoning pattern where a condition (successful sale of subsidiaries) and a hypothetical result (doubling of stock price in two years) are followed by the actual result (no increase in stock price) and a conclusion that the sale of subsidiaries failed. Therefore, Choice (C) is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument provides a hypothetical scenario where the inflation rate would have decreased if the party's economic theories were sound, but in reality, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were incorrect.
  Choice C also uses the same format of a counterfactual conditional and its opposite conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument above suggests that because the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were far off the mark when it could have decreased if such theories were sound. 
  Thus, a similar reasoning would draw a conclusion based on an expected outcome but the opposite is observed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that the expected outcome did not occur, which implies that the initial premise was incorrect.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: The argument above suggests that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have decreased. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark. This reasoning ignores any other factors that could have influenced inflation rates. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument implies that economic theories cause inflation, and so the expectation is that if sound economic theories are in effect, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased. Therefore the economic theories were flawed.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound, inflation rate would have decreased. But that is not the case, so the theories are flawed.

Topic: Law
Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____.
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement?
Choices:
  A: foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve
  B: foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
  C: only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries
  D: foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries
  E: cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that cabinet secretaries should be citizens because they perform duties that only citizens should perform.
  Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to step in as cabinet secretary if needed, thus this is relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The government official wants to prevent foreign citizens from serving as Cabinet secretaries.
  The official justifies this decision because cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens.
  Cabinet undersecretaries should be able to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
Action: Answer("D")  
Reasoning: 
  If foreign citizens are prevented from serving as Cabinet secretaries, then it would make sense for the government official to suggest that foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries. That is, option D best completes the statement by providing a reason why the official believes that foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as Cabinet secretaries.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that there are some duties that only citizens should perform.
  This is why foreign citizens are not eligible to become cabinet secretaries.
  Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is not available.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument highlights that cabinet secretaries should only be citizens.
  Undersecretaries may need to take the role as secretaries, and hence, they also need to be citizens.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels except as cabinet secretaries.
  The reason being the duties performed by cabinet secretaries should be performed only by citizens.
  Additionally, a cabinet undersecretary can serve as secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  So, the statement should complete logically based on this context.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation:
  The given statement describes the restriction on foreign citizens serving as cabinet secretaries, but it does not explain what should be done with undersecretaries.
  Option B - "foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries" follows logically from the argument because undersecretaries may have to step up as cabinet secretaries when they are unavailable. 
  It completes the argument most logically. 
  Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Cabinet secretaries perform some duties that only citizens are authorized to perform.
  Undersecretaries are expected to serve as secretaries when they are unavailable.
  Therefore, it is likely that the missing statement will indicate that foreign citizens should not serve as cabinet secretaries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Cabinet secretaries perform some duties only citizens should perform.
  Cabinet undersecretaries should be able to perform the duties of the actual secretary.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The government official argued that cabinet secretaries should not perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens. Moreover, undersecretaries serve as cabinet secretaries when they are unavailable. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  The official's statement suggests that cabinet secretaries need to perform some duties that non-citizens can't perform. Therefore, no one should be appointed as a cabinet secretary if he/she can't perform their duties. It is not logical to appoint a foreign citizen at that level. The argument implies that foreign citizens are suitable for all public servant positions except for cabinet secretary, so Answer D best completes the government official's statement.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The government official believes that cabinet secretaries should not perform duties that only citizens should perform.
  Undersecretaries should be capable of serving as secretaries in their absence.
  Cabinet secretaries are not allowed to be foreign citizens.
Action: Answer("D") 
Since cabinet secretaries are not allowed to be foreign citizens, the only logical response to the government official's statements is that foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet secretaries.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The official argues that foreigners can serve as public servants but cannot be cabinet secretaries because there are some duties that only citizens should do, and undersecretaries are expected to take up the duties of the secretary when unavailable. 
  To complete this argument logically, the answer choice must continue with this reasoning.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission believes that wetland development may not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth and the Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that development/endangerment of wildlife should be offset by construction of replacement habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission appears to prioritize national development whereas the Figorian Wildlife Commission prioritizes conservation of wildlife and the environment.
  Therefore, a principle that prioritizes national development will support the Figorian Development Commission more as compared to the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development is necessary for growth and that they have the right to govern their own resources. The Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission wants to allow the wetland development since it is necessary for growth and Figoria has the right for governing its own resources.
  The most relevant principle that supports the Figorian Development Commission's position might be the one that states that an individual nation has the right to govern its own resources.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission argues that they have the right to govern their own resources and that wetland development might not affect wildlife but it's necessary for growth.
  Thus, they would support a principle that prioritizes their right to govern their own resources over the preservation of wildlife.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission is arguing that they have the right to govern their own resources.
  They believe that the growth of their nation requires wetland development and conservation is not necessary.
  To support this, they would need a principle that supports the right of individual nations to use their resources as they choose.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
Since the Figorian Development Commission is arguing against regulating wetland development, their principle would need to contradict the regulatory approach of the Figorian Wildlife Commission.
  Option A suggests that international agreement is required to regulate national resources in cases where wildlife is in danger. This principle supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's regulatory approach, not the Figorian Development Commission's.
  Option B indicates that future generations' right to wildlife preservation overrides the current economic needs of nations. The Figorian Development Commission believes that developing wetlands is necessary for growth, so this principle would contradict their position.
  Option C suggests that regulation should only occur once a population reduction of endangered species by commercial development has been identified. This principle is incompatible with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's approach and is irrelevant to the Figorian Development Commission's stance.
  Option D suggests that environmental regulation should aim to prevent all additional environmental harm and cannot approve of previous environmental harm done to different degrees by other countries. This principle is irrelevant to the Figorian Development Commission's stand on developing Figorian wetlands.
  Option E would contradict the Figorian Development Commission's position that developing Figorian wetlands is necessary for growth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission wants to offset any wetland development by constructing replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The Figorian Development Commission wants to develop wetlands and thinks that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  The principle could most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position if it argues that Figoria has the right to use its resources as it wishes.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth.
  They also state that Figoria has as much right to govern its own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
  Thus, the principle that most strongly supports this position would be the one that recognizes the right of individual nations to develop their resources.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Development Commission supports the development of wetlands, while Figorian Wildlife Commission seeks to protect wildlife by regulating such development.
  Figorian Development Commission believes that Figorian wetland development, which may not affect wildlife, is necessary for growth while Figorian Wildlife Commission believes that offsetting wetland habitats is necessary to protect wildlife.
  A principle that supports Figorian Development Commission's position must prioritize the development of Figorian natural resources over the conservation of wildlife.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is that wetland development in Figoria might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, so it should be allowed.
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is that wetland development in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species, so future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.

Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The columnist is suggesting that the fact that a bill most people favor, and that does not violate human rights, is not being passed into law, shows that this country is not a well-functioning democracy.
  The reasoning is that people who would be adversely affected by the bill, if it becomes law, are very influential. 
  The principle that justifies the columnist's reasoning should be related to the fact that influential people can prevent a bill from being passed, even if it is favored by most people and does not violate basic human rights.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The columnist's argument is that the bill will not be passed because influential people oppose it, which shows that the democracy is not functioning well.
  Principle B states that a bill opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually be passed into law.
  This principle justifies the columnist's reasoning and supports their argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not pass because those being adversely affected are very influential.
  The principle that best supports this claim is a statement about what happens in a well-functioning democracy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The columnist is arguing that the bill, which most people favor and does not violate basic human rights, won't be passed because those who would be adversely affected are influential.
  This justification must imply that the bill, which most people favor and does not violate basic human rights, can still be blocked in a well-functioning democracy if those affected are influential.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The columnist asserts that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not be passed if influential people oppose it.
  Option B provides justification by stating that a well-functioning democracy will enact laws even if the influential people oppose it, as long as most people favor it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed even though it would benefit most people, and this shows that the country is not a well-functioning democracy. So, the principle that justifies this reasoning must be related to the non-passage of the bill and the notion of a well-functioning democracy.
Action: Answer("B")  
Justification: Option B states that for a well-functioning democracy, any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. This reasoning justifies the columnist's argument that the bill will not pass, despite being favored by most people, due to the opposition of influential people. Furthermore, the principle suggested by option B is consistent with the notion of a well-functioning democracy.
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The columnist argues that the bill will not be passed, despite the fact that the bill and the passing of the bill do not violate anyone's basic human rights. This is because those who would be adversely affected were the bill to become law are powerful. 
  Thus, the justification that best supports the columnist's reasoning is the one that argues how adverse parties could be influential in democracy.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: The columnist argues that although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. The reason for this is because those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Justification: Option (B) states that if a democracy is well-functioning then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law, which explains the columnist's reasoning that even though most people favor the bill it won't be passed because those against it are very influential.

Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The biologist claims that the usefulness of our five fingers is no greater than if we had six fingers.
  Option E may suggest that having six fingers may not be biologically disadvantageous.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
 The argument above suggests that dried parsley is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. 
 It also concludes that dried parsley should never be used in cooking. 
 This suggests that the principle that justifies the argument above is that when it comes to cooking, fresh ingredients are better than dried ones. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that does not refute the argument that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries.
  C weakens the argument by indicating that there are more accountants than actuaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler must have been an actuary because accountants are less likely to make mistakes, and therefore less likely to be caught. They have eliminated the possibility of entry-level accountants, but nothing more senior and trustworthy.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show something that indicates that even more senior or higher-level accountants would not have done it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is based on the assumption that it is more likely for the actuaries to have embezzled the money since the accountant wouldn't have made the mistake found in the ledger.
  We need to find the choice that doesn't affect this assumption.
  Choice A weakens this assumption because it suggests that the accountants' activities were closely scrutinized and under closer supervision. This reduces the likelihood of accountants committing the crime.
  Choice B weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the crime.
  Choice C doesn't affect the argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument since it took place before the crime.
  Choice E weakens the argument by suggesting that actuaries were less likely to access financial records.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  To weaken an argument, we should provide evidence that contradicts the logic or facts presented in the argument.
  A, B, C, and E each provide evidence that contradict the detective's argument.
  D seems not to be related to the detective's argument, so it is the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely to be an actuary because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes recorded.
  To weaken the argument, an option has to show a possibility that an accountant could have committed the crime or contradict the given premise.
  Option C seems irrelevant to the argument made by the detective.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument states that the specialized knowledge required for the embezzlement points to one of the actuaries. 
  We need to find the option that doesn't influence this argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is one of the actuaries, not one of the eight accountants. 
  To weaken the argument, we need to provide evidence that contradicts this conclusion. 
  Options A, B, D, and E provide possible contradictions; option C does not contribute.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler can only be one of the actuaries.
  The question asks us to identify choices that do not weaken the argument.
  We need to find the choice that supports the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the embezzler is one of the actuaries based on the premise that accountants would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. We need to find the option that does not undermine this line of reasoning.
  Choice A provides a reason why the accountant could also be the embezzler.
  Choice B introduces a possibility that the embezzler could be an outsider.
  Choice C suggests that the probability of the embezzler being one of the accountants is higher.
  Choice D establishes the fact that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement even before it took place and does not affect the argument.
  Choice E is a reason why the actuaries could not have embezzled.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks for an option that does not weaken the detective's argument, which relies on the assumption that the embezzler is an actuary rather than an accountant.
  (A) Weakens the detective's argument since it implies that the accountants' mistakes might be caught more readily than the actuaries'.
  (B) Weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the embezzler might not have been an employee of XYZ Corporation.
  (C) Weakens the detective's argument since it suggests that an employee that embezzled might have been an accountant.
  (D) Weakens the detective's argument since it suggests that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement prior to the crime.
  (E) Weakens the detective's argument since it implies that the accountants might have had more access to internal documents than the actuaries did.

Topic: Law
Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle stated above talks about the harm and contempt in a practical joke.
  The options that correctly apply this principle are A, C, and D. 
  B is incorrect because it does not address the potential harm.
  E is incorrect because it does not mention the contempt.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 1:
Thought:
  The principle states that practical jokes that show contempt for or might bring significant harm to someone should not be played.
  We have to select an argument that resonates with this principle.
  Option A expresses that it is wrong to play a practical joke that may bring significant harm to someone.
  Option B argues that if the joke does not cause significant harm or shows no contempt for someone, it is not wrong to play it. This idea goes against our principle.
  Option C acknowledges that the joke may not show contempt for someone but may still bring significant harm, making it wrong to play.
  Option D indicates that the joke would not significantly harm anyone, but it still shows contempt for someone.
  Option E admits that even if the joke does not show contempt for someone, if someone gets harmed, it is wrong to play it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The principle suggests that a practical joke is unjustifiable if it shows contempt or brings harm to a person.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument that justifies practical jokes are ones that do neither show contempt for the person nor significantly harm them.
  Choice A mentions "even if it is not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone," which shows that they cared about the harm that might be caused.
  Choice B mentions only that there is no reason to believe that playing the joke would cause harm or show contempt, but it doesn't have enough justification.
  Choice C mentions that the joke will cause significant harm.
  Choice D mentions that it would show contempt for someone.
  Choice E gives justification to not play a practical joke that caused harm.
Action: Answer("A")   
Response 4:
Thought:
  The principle states that one should not play a practical joke that shows contempt for someone or could bring significant harm.
  We have to pick the argument that closely resembles the principle.

Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The focus of movie executives is to maximize revenue from ticket sales, while television executives' focus is not on maximizing the number of viewers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
The primary goal of movie executives is different from that of television executives.
To understand this difference, we need a statement that tells us about the unique factor that impacts the goals of both executives.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: Option D provides a viable explanation to why the goals of movie and television executives differ. It states that television executives make their profits from sponsors, who are mostly concerned with the purchasing power of people who watch the show. They can, therefore, make smaller profits with a smaller audience, provided the audience has high purchasing power. Movie executives, however, depend on ticket sales, and therefore, increasing the number of viewers is their chief concern.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Movie executives need to maximize the number of people who see a film to make a profit.
  Television executives do not necessarily need to maximize the number of viewers to make a profit.
  The answer will provide reasoning for this difference in goals.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see the film so that they make a profit.  
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Reasoning: 
  If television shows make their profits from sponsors who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch the show, then the primary goal of television executives would be to ensure that the people who watch the show are likely to purchase the advertised products. While increasing the number of people who watch the show can increase profits from advertising, it may not be the primary goal as compared to films where the primary goal is to maximize audience size to generate ticket sales. Option D best explains the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives among the given options.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film to generate enough revenue from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers, but they need a significant number of viewers to make profits from sponsors.
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film to ensure profitability.
  However, television executives have a different goal than movie executives.
  One of the options must explain the difference between their goals.

Response 6:
Thought: 
  The question asks about the difference between the goals of movie and television executives. 
  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of viewers, while it is not the primary goal of television executives for their shows.
  We need to find an option that clearly explains this difference.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation:
  Option D helps to explain that television executives' primary goal is not to maximize the number of viewers. Instead, their goal is to make profits from sponsors, who are mainly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This does not depend on the number of viewers. Hence, this option clearly addresses the difference between the goals of movie and television executives. The other options do not adequately explain this difference.

Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle states that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Option A describes a situation where Riley could not foresee the misfortune caused by parking in the center lane, and hence he should not be blamed.
  Option B describes a situation where Oblicek could not reasonably have foreseen the misfortune caused by suggesting the loan and hence should not be blamed.
  Option C describes a situation where Gougon was concerned about the misfortune but still caused it, so he should be blamed.
  Option D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick did not know about misfortune caused by the wrong medicine, and hence no one other than him should be blamed.
  Option E describes a situation where Kapp could have reasonably foreseen the misfortune but still caused it, so she should be blamed.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  According to the principle, only if the person could not reasonably have foreseen the misfortune, he should not be blamed.
  Option A: Riley should have realized that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. It is not reasonable that he didn't foresee it. Incorrect.
  Option B: Oblicek had no idea and there is no reason to suspect that she could have reasonably foreseen this. It supports the principle above. Correct.

Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

Action: Answer("A") 
Choice A most seriously weakens the argument by stating that if the issue is too complicated, even jurors with no specialized knowledge will have a hard time comprehending the testimony. Their ability to comprehend the testimony is unrelated to whether they have specialized knowledge or not.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is that trial by jury is not fair for disputes involving scientific or technical issues since specialized people are excluded.
  We need to find an answer choice that suggests that trial by jury can still be fair despite excluding people with specialized knowledge.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument is that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making it unfair to involve trials where that issue is relevant.
  The weakener will have to explain or show how this is not a problem or that there is a better alternative, or the argument is not correct.
  Option A seems to strengthen the argument.
  Option C and E provide alternatives but not related to the argument.
  Option D is not significant enough to weaken the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes on scientific or technical issues due to absence of specialized knowledge.
  We need to find an option that presents evidence to the contrary.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries.
  We need to find a statement that suggests trial by jury is still fair despite the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that excluding jurors with specialized knowledge make trials unfair in cases requiring scientific or technical knowledge. To weaken the argument, we need to prove that specialized jurors' exclusion does not hugely harm trials' fairness.
  Option A attributes the significance of non-specialist jurors which contradicts the original argument. Thus, it may weaken the argument. 
  The other options do not directly relate to the argument or act against it but try to provide new evidence to support solutions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
 The argument claims that excluding jurors with specialized knowledge makes trials unfair.
 We need to choose a choice that contradicts that claim.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
 If the more complicated the issue being litigated, the more likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given, then the argument doesn't hold water. The jurors can still understand the issue being litigated regardless of their level of knowledge of the scientific and technical issue involved. Therefore, Jurors without this specialized knowledge may still be capable of making fair decisions.

Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The geologist argues that petroleum is formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  This argument is refuted by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  We need to find a statement that weakens the refutation offered by the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 1:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is based on the presence of biomarkers in petroleum.
  We need to find a statement that shows biomarkers are not necessarily a result of the past or present existence of a living organism.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers defeats the theory that petroleum did not form from living material.
  To weaken the argument, we need a statement that weakens the connection between petroleum and fossils or biomarkers.
  Choice A weakens the connection between fossils and biomarkers.
  Choice B is irrelevant.
  Choice C supports the geologist's argument.
  Choice D is irrelevant.
  Choice E weakens the opposing theory, but does not affect the geologist's argument directly.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument of the geologist is that the petroleum formation theory based on deep carbon deposits is refuted by the presence of biomarkers.
  We need to find an option that undermines the significance of the biomarkers.
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 4:
Thought:
The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum suggests that it must have come from living organisms. To weaken this argument it would have to be shown that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily indicate life.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust, and this is supported by biomarkers.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily support the argument.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation: 
  Choice A weakens the argument by showing that fossils can exist without biomarkers, which means that the absence of biomarkers may not be sufficient to deny the possibility of fossilization.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum suggests that it is formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms.
  We need to find the option that weakens this argument.
  Options A, B, C, and D do not directly weaken the argument.
  Option E attacks the alternative view to the geologist's view.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum confirms traditional theories that believe in fossil fuels' origins from living organisms.
  We need to find an option that weakens the argument by showing why the presence of biomarkers doesn't necessarily mean that petroleum comes from living organisms.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation:
  Option B weakens the geologist's argument since, according to it, living organisms emerged long after the earth's formation. Therefore, petroleum would have to have a different origin, whether it contains biomarkers or not.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of living organisms due to the presence of biomarkers.
  To weaken this argument we need to provide evidence that supports petroleum was formed in ways other than from the remains of living organisms.
  Option B and D are out of context.
  Option A might strengthen the argument and Option C only provides additional information.
  Option E directly contradicts the explanation offered by opposing scientists, thereby debunking their argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The geologist's argument is that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum proves that petroleum formed from the remains of living organisms.
  If there is an alternative explanation for the origin of the biomarkers, then that weakens the argument.

Topic: Law
Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The student argues that if many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, they have immunity to this microorganism, which is fallacious.
  The flaw in the student's argument is that they assume that the immunity to infection is the only explanation for why many people don't develop harmful symptoms after exposure to staphylococcus.
  Option A shares a similar flaw by assuming that moral rightness is the only measure of whether an action serves the interests of everyone.
  Option B shares no logical similarity to the student's argument.
  Option C shares a similar flaw by assuming that medication is the only explanation for curing diseases and alleviating symptoms.
  Option D shares a similar flaw by assuming that excessive taxation is the only explanation for the decline in business expansions.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
The student makes a general conclusion that people have immunity to staphylococcus without providing any evidence that staphylococcus does not cause some people to develop harmful symptoms. Therefore, the student's argument is flawed.
The flawed reasoning pattern in the student's argument is best similar to option C. 
Option C presents a situation where Isabel says she would take medication but is still sick, and the conclusion is drawn that medication either cures a disease or alleviates its symptoms.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The student concludes that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection while ignoring that the reason for no harmful symptoms may have other reasons.
  This reasoning pattern is similar to one of the choices.
  Choice (C) contains a similar flawed pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that because many people did not develop symptoms after being exposed to staphylococcus, they have immunity to it. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true, since there may be other reasons as to why they do not develop symptoms.
  Choice (C) seems to demonstrate a similar flawed pattern of reasoning in which the conclusion is drawn based on incomplete or unstated assumptions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The student's argument is that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing harmful symptoms. It follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.   This conclusion is flawed because exposure to staphylococcus does not mean they have immunity to it.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The student reasons that since a person does not develop harmful symptoms from a microorganism, they must have an immunity to it.
  This is flawed since some people do not show symptoms without necessarily being immune to the microorganism.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The flawed pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is "If A is true, then B is true." An example of this pattern is if someone is a parent, then they are a good person. However, many parents are not good people. Thus, having a quality does not necessarily imply the other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: The argument concludes that people have immunity to staphylococcus because many of them do not develop harmful symptoms after exposure. This may not be true because some people may have strong immune systems. The argument jumps to a conclusion without considering other factors that may contribute to the absence of harmful symptoms in many people. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The student is claiming that lack of harmful symptoms equals immunity. 
  This is a flawed assumption; lack of harmful symptoms alone does not prove that a person is immune.
  Choice C is similar in that it draws a conclusion based on an obviously flawed assumption.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The student's argument has a flawed pattern of reasoning that includes the assumption that a person who does not develop harmful symptoms must have an immunity to the microorganism that causes those symptoms.
  Choice A seems unrelated to the flawed reasoning pattern.
  Choice B and E are incorrect because they do not contain the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the student's argument.

Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The journalist argues that the physician employed by the company that manufactures the drug has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous, and hence, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects. This argument can be criticized on the grounds that it might take for granted that anyone associated with the company that manufactures the drug is entirely unable to evaluate evidence or that the author of the book might have been biased for personal reasons. The answer choice that implies this criticism is the correct one.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the physician's employment with the manufacturing company creates a personal reason to deny the book's claims.
  The argument may be criticized if it presumes that association with the manufacturing company renders the physician incapable of making an objective assessment of the drug's side effects. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the physician's critique is biased because they work for the company that manufactures the drug, but it's possible that the critique is still valid.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the basis of whether this possibility is addressed.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician who critiqued it works for the drug's manufacturer and may have personal reasons to deny the drug's dangers.
  The journalist assumes that the physician's critique was invalid only because of their association with the company.
  We need to find which option points out the vulnerability or weakness of this line of thinking.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims.
  The physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  The physician may have personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  The argument assumes that the physician's association with the drug company is the only reason to dismiss the critique.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The journalist claims that the physician's critique cannot be legitimate because he is employed by the company manufacturing the drug. 
  However, this assumption may not always be valid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the physician's critique has personal reasons to deny the drug is dangerous.
  Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  So, the journalist is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that ignore the potentiality of other legitimate reasons for the physician to deny side effect claims.
  Hence, we can rule out options (A), (C), and (E).
  The option (B) could be valid as it is bringing generalization that anyone remotely associated with a company could not give a fair judgement.
  Option (D) could be valid as it is questioning the validity of the journalist's claim that critique cannot provide legitimate grounds for the book's other claims.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the physician's critique may be biased.
  However, this does not prove the book's claims about the drug's side effect to be correct.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism regarding this point.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  The argument implies that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim is unable to provide legitimate grounds for denying it.
  This assumption is the target of criticisms in the question.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: The journalist concludes that the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug, which could lead to personal bias. However, this conclusion may fail if the argument is vulnerable on the following grounds.
(A) The argument does not address any other claims made in the book.
(B) It is possible that the physician is still able to weigh the evidence fairly.
(C) The argument does not address the possibility of the author's bias.
(D) This statement seems to be a possibility, but it is not specifically related to this argument.
(E) This statement is similar to the first answer.

Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also mentions that the food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments.
  Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The conflict presented is that the evolution of the modern human brain required a high-calorie diet and the food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments, while the evolution of the human brain's took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, we need an answer that resolves the apparent conflict.
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation:
  Choice E is the correct answer because it explains that gathering food in shore environments was harder and required more expenditure of calories by early humans than in other environments, which means that even though their food resources could support such a diet, it was more efficient for them to gather food from savanna and woodland areas.
Response 2:
Thought:
The question asks for the option that most helps to resolve the apparent conflict presented above. 
The conflict is that the high-calorie diet was available in shore environments but the human brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas.
Option A, B, D, and E do not seem to resolve the conflict with the given passage.
Option C seems like it helps to resolve the conflict by stating that the prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today. This would make them more attractive to early humans.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage states that shore enviroment had sufficient resources for the diet that would support the evolution of the brain, yet the evolution of the brain took place in woodland and savanna areas.
  We need to select an answer that will provide insight into why the brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Action: Answer("E")   
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument explains why the human brain evolved in a specific environment, despite the abundance of resources in another environment.
  We need to explain how the resources in this specific environment were particularly important.
  If the calories required to gather food in the shore environments were more than in woodland areas, it would explain why the human brain evolved in woodland areas despite the abundance of resources in the shore. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument states that early humans evolved their high-calorie diet in shores but their brain evolved in savanna and woodland areas. 
  We need to find an option that will help to explain why the human brain's evolution occurred in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The apparent conflict is that the high-calorie diet needed for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain was most abundant and reliable in the shore environments, but the brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve the apparent conflict, we need information that could explain why the brain's evolution did not take place in the shore environments even when the high-calorie diet was available there.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument notes that high-calorie diets were crucial to the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain. Food resources supporting a high-calorie diet were most abundant and reliable in shore environments, yet the human brain evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas. The correct answer should help resolve this apparent conflict.
Action: Answer("E") 
Explanation: 
  Choice E states that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. Thus, even though such resources were more abundant, it was more difficult to gather them, and this could have led to early humans not relying on that food source for their high-calorie diet requirements as much as on resources available in savanna and woodland areas. Therefore, E helps resolve the apparent conflict presented above.
Response 8:
Thought:
The conflict presented is the contrast between the need for high-calorie and fat-rich diets to develop the human brain in shore environments, and the fact that the evolution of the brain took place in savanna and woodland areas. 
Action: Answer("E")  
Explanation:
Choice (E) provides a good explanation for how the contradiction noted in the prompt can be reconciled. Early humans might have been better off developing bigger brains in savanna and woodland areas because that's where food was abundant and readily available. Alternatively, gathering food in shore environments was much harder, so even though the nutritional value of the food there was superior, early humans would not have had enough food to perform extensive brain evolution.
Response 9:
Thought:
   The apparent conflict is the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas but food required for brain evolution was most abundant and reliable in the shore environments
   To resolve the apparent conflict, we need to find some statement which explains why early humans did not evolve their brain in shore environments.
   Option A, B, and D are irrelevant to the apparent conflict 
   Option C increases the reliability of resources in prehistoric areas but doesn't explain why early humans did not evolve their brains in the shore environments.
   Option E may explain why the early humans did not evolve their brain in the shore environments because gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. Therefore this option seems the most appropriate.

Topic: Law
Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to
Choices:
  A: question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice
  B: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses
  C: allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation
  D: contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence
  E: maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Amar argues that implementing Sarah's recommendation would lead to more accidents.
  Therefore, Amar is pointing out a potential negative consequence of Sarah's recommendation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation: Unlike Sarah's argument that commercial fishing permits should be altered so that fish caught accidentally can be kept and not wasted, Amar's argument contends that if permits are altered to allow fishers to keep accidentally caught fish, it could lead to a lot more "accidents". Thus, Amar is pointing out that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D") 

Thought: 
Amar is not refuting Sarah’s claim of changing the policy, but he is disputing the potential positive outcome of such a change in the policy. By saying "Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents." he is putting forth that there could be an unwanted consequence of the policy change.
Response 3:
Thought:
  Amar disagrees with Sarah's recommendation.
  Amar argues that making it legal to keep those fish would lead to a lot more "accidents."
  Amar does not provide any supporting evidence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D") 

Thought: 
  Amar is countering Sarah's argument by pointing out that her recommendation has a negative consequence as well, which could outweigh the benefits of her proposal.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D") 

The technique Amar uses is to contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence, which is that making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D") 

Thought: 
Amar presents a counterargument to Sarah's proposal by suggesting that her solution would lead to a significant problem. He believes that allowing fishers to keep the fish caught accidentally would increase the number of such "accidents," which could harm the environment. This indicates that Amar is discussing a downside of Sarah's proposition. 
Option D - Contend that Sarah's recommendation has an essential negative consequence, is the most fitting option.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")  

Thought:
Amar's response is that changing the fishing permits would have an unintended consequence of more accidental catches. This is a negative outcome that he identifies from Sarah's proposal. 
Thus, Amar contends that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence. 

Therefore, the best answer is D.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D") 

Thought:
Amar is negating Sarah's recommendation by arguing that it can have negative consequences. Amar is claiming that if commercial fishing boats with permits are allowed to keep fish caught accidentally, it could lead to more accidents.
Response 9:
Thought: Amar is making an argument against Sarah's recommendation. His argument is based on the possible negative consequences of her recommendation.

Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The antidote for chicken pox has no serious side effects and is currently effective.
  Researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous -> To reconcile the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the current effectiveness and the lack of serious side effects should not be considered sufficient to recommend the drug for wide use.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The apparent discrepancy is that the researchers warn about the danger of a drug developed to cure chicken pox despite the fact that it is very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox and has no serious side effects. Therefore, the correct option should reconcile these contradictory statements by explaining why the drug is not a good option even though it is effective and has no serious side effects.
A: The drug's cost and difficulty to make widely available is irrelevant to explaining why the drug is dangerous.
B: This option explains that patient compliance with the drug will be low, but it does not explain the apparent discrepancy between the warning and effectiveness of the drug.
C: This option explains the limitations of the drug in terms of preventing the spread of chicken pox, but it does not explain the danger of using the drug despite its effectiveness and lack of serious side effects.
D: This option explains a valid danger of this drug, but it fails to reconcile the discrepancy.
E: This option contradicts the statement that the drug is effective, and hence the statement itself is incorrect and does not reconcile the discrepancy.
Action: Answer("D")

  We need to look for an option that helps with reconciling the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question states that using the antidote could be dangerous.
  The drug is effective at limiting duration and severity of chickenpox.
  There is a discrepancy that needs to be reconciled.
Action: Answer("C") 
  The drug does well in curing the primary victim but does not stop the spread of chickenpox. Since the drug would cure the chicken pox in the primary victim, it would be difficult to control the spread of the disease, and administering the drug could become dangerous.
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Researchers have warned that widespread use of the antidote for chicken pox could be dangerous.
  The drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  To help reconcile the discrepancy, we need to identify a statement that provides a reason for the warning despite having no serious side effects and being effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Action: Answer("E")

Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument presents a hypothesis on the expected outcome based on expert knowledge.
  The expected outcome did not happen, so the hypothesis was probably not correct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument presents a person's opinion based on their expertise.
  The expert had a specific expectation.
  The expected outcome did not occur.
  The conclusion is that the expectation was not met because of a failure related to the opposite of the expert's chosen subject.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The argument uses a specific person's expertise, Wells's knowledge of the concert business, to make a prediction about an event, the concert selling out, and concludes that the opposite occurred, it did not sell out.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument talks about the opinion of a knowledgeable person about an event.
  The knowledgeable person was certain of the event's success unless there was something wrong.
  The event did not meet the expected level of success.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that Wells, who is knowledgeable about concerts, believes that the concert would sell out if promoted properly, and since it did not sell out, it was probably not promoted properly. This is similar to option B, where Professor Willis, who is knowledgeable about organic chemistry, believes that a sample probably does not contain organic compounds. And since he believes it does not contain organic compounds, it is probably not labeled correctly.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that the concert did not sell out, despite the assertions of Wells that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  This pattern of reasoning is similar to Option B, where Professor Willis suggests that the sample is incorrectly labeled as it does not contain any organic compounds. 
  In both cases, a knowledgeable individual predicts a certain outcome unless something is done improperly; when that outcome fails to transpire, it is suggested that something was improperly done.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that the concert was not properly promoted because Wells was knowledgeable about the concert business and it did not sell out.
  The correct choice will present a similar pattern of reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Premise: Wells claimed that the concert would sell out unless it was poorly promoted.
  Premise: The concert did not sell out.
  Conclusion: The concert was probably not properly promoted.
  This is similar to option B because Professor Willis stated that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds, and therefore, it probably was not labeled correctly.

Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak.
Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable?
Choices:
  A: The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  C: The word "behavior" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument.
  D: The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  E: The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents evidence that walking upright is natural behavior for Kodiak bears.
  The argument concludes that walking upright is instinctive and not learned behavior.
  The criticism that the argument is most vulnerable to is the one that challenges the evidence.
  Option A is critical of the presented evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is based on the determinations made based on the physical characteristics of Kodiak bears that walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior.
  The argument does not involve generalization.
  The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
  The argument does not illegitimately change the meaning of behavior.
  The argument does not presume that there are only two ways to explain animal behavior.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument states that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears and is not a learned behavior. 
  The criticism most vulnerable would be one that challenges this reasoning, or the evidence behind it, and thus casts doubt on its validity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is natural to Kodiak bears because of their bones structure. 
  The argument assumes there is no learning involved and it is against their instinct.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that walking on hind legs is a completely natural behavior of Kodiak bears based on the shape of their bones.
  The argument might be vulnerable to criticism that it incorrectly generalizes from a few Kodiak bears to all Kodiak bears.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument is about Kodiak bears and suggests that their walking on hind legs is natural and instinctive.
  There might be some other explanation that the argument ignores.
  The argument talks about the walking behavior of all Kodiak bears without providing sufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument suggests that walking on hind legs is an instinctive behavior for Kodiak bears and was determined based on the shape of their hip and foot bones, indicating an innate capacity.
  It does not generalize from the behavior of only a few bears.
  It does not fail to consider the possibility of walking on hind legs being a combination of learning and innate capacity.
  It does not change the meaning of the word "behavior".
  It does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  It does not rely on the authority of science to support the conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument implies that the Kodiak bear's ability to stand and walk upright is entirely innate.
  The question asks which criticism is the argument most vulnerable to.
  A and E are not applicable.
  D is incorrect as the argument doesn't presume that behavior is only caused by nature or nurture.
  Between B and C, C misrepresents the argument by adding information that isn't there, so the answer must be B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument talks about the behavior of Kodiak bears.
  It presents a conclusion regarding the bears' instinctive behavior.
  We need to find a criticism that the argument is most vulnerable to.
  A criticism that attacks the argument's conclusion would be most vulnerable.
  A, C, and D are not doing that.
  E is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
  B brings up an interesting point, but it is not attacking the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument in the given text states that it has been determined that walking on hind legs is instinctive behavior of Kodiak bears and not a learned behavior; hence, any criticism related to this conclusion can be the most vulnerable.
  The given choices can be eliminated one-by-one to reach the answer.
    A can be eliminated as the argument mentions "Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears." This implies that the conclusion is reached based on the anatomy of Kodiak bears and not just their behavior.
    C can be eliminated as the meaning of the word "behavior" has not changed throughout.
    D can be eliminated as the argument only mentions that walking on hind legs is instinctive behavior without excluding the possibility of existence of other innate behaviors in Kodiak bears.
    E can be eliminated as the argument is not trying to appeal to the authority of science.

Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that freedom of thought is necessary but insufficient for intellectual progress because thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine full implications.
  The conclusion follows if a premise is assumed that connects freedom of thought to intellectual discipline.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The conclusion drawn by the professor asserts that intellectual discipline is essential for intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the assumption needs to support that intellectual discipline is necessary for finding the full implications of interrelated ideas.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument in the context claims that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress and it needs intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if one of the options provides evidence that supports the argument.
  Option A is related but not enough to fully support the argument.
  Option B focuses on society but is not related to the intellectual discipline.
  Option C contradicts the argument because it suggests that freedom of thought and intellectual discipline are mutually exclusive and cannot be both achieved.
  Option D is only limited to the discovery of truth and is not general enough to support the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress and that thinkers need intellectual discipline.
  The conclusion that the argument for freedom of thought fails is logical if it can be assumed that some disagreement exists between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline.
  Choice A and D are irrelevant to the conclusion drawn by the professor.
  Choice B and C cannot be the assumption because the professor does not mention anything about the context or society in which intellectual progress takes place.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The professor argues that even though freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, thinkers still need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress. The conclusion drawn will assume something along the same lines.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought alone does not enable intellectual progress.
  Therefore, the conclusion will logically follow if freedom of thought requires intellectual discipline.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The professor argues that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is necessary to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas.
  If the professor's conclusion is to logically follow, there must be an assumption that supports this.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Prompt: concise | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument discusses the neck structure of Diplodocus and its feeding habits.
To make an argument, the author needs to make an assumption.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus cannot raise its neck to browse high vegetation from trees due to the structure of its neck bones.
  Instead, it used its flexible neck to reach underwater vegetation from dry land.
  An assumption needed by the argument must be relevant to the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones or its feeding habits.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument suggests that Diplodocus had to have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater because its neck could not bend upwards to allow it to reach high-growing vegetation.
  Therefore, an assumption required by the argument must be relevant to how the dinosaur gathered or obtained its food.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that Diplodocus neck could not have been used to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  Diplodocus neck has a structure that allows it to bend downward and extend below ground level.
  We can infer that Diplodocus fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument discusses the feeding pattern of Diplodocus, explaining how it would feed from underwater vegetation.
  The assumption required should help explain why the computer models used in the argument are accurate.
  Among the choices, only (A) is related to the validity of the computer models used in the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Assumption is a premise that is implicit in the argument.
  The argument talks about the limit of Diplodocus's neck movement and suggests possible feeding habits of Diplodocus based on its neck structure.
  The assumption must be related to the argument and reasonable to make the argument valid.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The argument suggests that Diplodocus's neck bones could not have allowed it to raise its neck as previously believed. Thus, it must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. So, the assumption required by the argument should be related to these two feeding methods.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find the assumption required by the argument.
  The argument states that Diplodocus's neck structure prevented the movement of raising the neck high to browse treetop leaves.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
As per the context, there is a computer model that shows that Diplodocus's neck could not have been raised up to browse high-growing vegetation, so it must have fed on plants near the ground or underwater. We need to find an assumption that is required by the argument made.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: The argument talks about the limitations of Diplodocus's neck and suggests an alternative explanation for its diet. Therefore, an assumption required by the argument should pertain to Diplodocus's ability to feed on vegetation.

Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
  B: The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove.
  C: The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself.
  D: The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted.
  E: The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it.
Response 0:
Thought: The argument assumes that the personal experience (knowing people who voted against) contradicts the official results, and concludes that the evidence is rigged. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The person is using a personal experience to judge a nationwide decision.
  Just because one person thinks that "everyone I know voted against the proposal," it doesn't necessarily reflect the overall national results.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The individual is basing their conclusion on their personal experience, which is not necessarily representative of the population at large. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The speaker claims that the official results must be rigged because everyone they know voted against the proposal.
  This is a hasty generalization fallacy because this only represents a sample that may not be representative of the general population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The conclusion is based on the limited personal experience of the speaker rather than a valid statistical sample.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that just because everyone they know voted against the proposal means that most people voted against it.
  Their observations of the people they personally know may not be representative of the general population.
  The argument uses anecdotes rather than comprehensive/representative evidence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The person's own personal experience is not necessarily an accurate representation of everyone's experience.
  The fact that everyone they know voted against the proposal is not a reliable way to measure the entire voting population's vote.
  Therefore, the conclusion that the results are rigged is not logically supported.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The argument claims that the official results are rigged because the person didn't know anyone who voted in favor of the proposal.
  However, this is not a representative sample of the entire population.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A") 

The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. The person only knows the voting behavior of the people they know, which may not be representative of the entire voting population.

Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine?
Choices:
  A: All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water.
  B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.
  C: A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine.
  D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
  E: Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The magazine is arguing that you need a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers to get clothes really clean.
  This assumes that there are differences in how regular detergent and front-loading detergent works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The magazine claims that a detergent formulated for front-loading washers is necessary to clean clothes in such a washer.
  The argument must assume something to prove that.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is about why a detergent formulated for front-loading washers is necessary to get clothes really clean in them.
  The argument assumes that some characteristic of front-loading washers interacts with laundry detergent to make ordinary powder detergent ineffective.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Conclusion: To get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, we need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers
  Premise: Ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers due to less water usage
  Assumption: Something about a detergent being formulated especially for front-loading washers is important
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers and it does not get clothes really clean.
  Therefore, a laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is required to get clothes really clean in them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that to clean clothes in a front-loading washer, a detergent formulated especially for it is required, as ordinary powder detergent doesn't dissolve readily in it due to the machine using less water. The assumption required by the argument should support the conclusion that using a detergent specially formulated for front-loading washers is the only way to get clothes really clean.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument in the consumer magazine is focused on the need of using a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  The assumption required for the argument should support the need for a special detergent.
  Options A, C, D, and E are not related to this assumption as they discuss other factors.
  Option B is directly related to the assumption because it's talking about the effectiveness of the detergent specifically formulated for the front-loading washers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  There is an assumption required to connect this premise to the conclusion.
  The assumption would provide that context to understand why ordinary detergent does not work well in front-loading machines.

  The argument states that ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
  Therefore, to get clothes really clean in front-loading washers, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers must be used.
  The assumption must be related to this argument.
  Regardless of the water usage, the argument is focusing on the detergent usage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument implies that for front-loading washers, one must use a laundry detergent that is especially formulated for front-loading washers.
  Therefore, it must be assumed that laundry detergents that are not formulated for front-loading washers do not dissolve readily in these washers.

Topic: Law
Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation.
Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it.
  B: No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it.
  C: My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it.
  D: My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse.
  E: Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument presents a causality issue that the lack of raise is caused by a poor evaluation, ignoring other possible reasons for the lack of raise.
  Choice B also presents a causality issue that the ownership of a house is caused by not paying rent on it, ignoring other methods of acquiring a house.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument uses a premise that states that no one has received a poor performance evaluation and a raise.
  The conclusion suggests that if someone has not received a raise, then they must have received a poor performance evaluation.
  This is a flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  Option A stands out as being similar to the argument above. 
  Both arguments use the same flawed reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that in order to receive poor evaluation or a raise, one must receive one but not both. It then uses the fact that Lester has not received a raise to conclude that he must have gotten a poor evaluation. This is not always true in reality. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument has a premise, but there is no guarantee that the conclusion is true.
  To reach the conclusion, the argument assumes that receiving a poor performance evaluation is the only reason one would not receive a raise.
  The argument is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a type of formal fallacy.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument above states a conditional relationship that if an employee didn't get a raise, then they received a poor performance evaluation. Therefore, the conclusion relates to the negative part of the conditional relationship.
  The argument in choice B uses a conditional relationship but concludes for the positive part of the conditional relationship.
  Therefore, Choice B has reasoning most similar to the argument present in the question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument follows the flawed reasoning of a negative inference.
  It concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because no one receives a raise and a poor evaluation.
  It ignores the possibility that Lester may not have received either a raise or a poor evaluation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument in the context tries to establish a causal relationship based on a negation construction. 
  The construction is: "No A and B, if not A then B".
  Choice D seems to have a similar structure.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Lester must have received a poor performance evaluation because he has not received a raise. This disregards the possibility that there are other reasons why Lester has not received a raise.
  Similarly, the correct answer choice should have an argument that concludes that something must be true based on one condition, while ignoring other possibilities.
  Choice A and E present similar reasoning to the original argument, but Choice E is a better match since it assumes that anyone who does not own a house must pay rent, disregarding other possibilities like living rent-free.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument involves two options A and B, and it is stated that one of them must be true.
  The argument assumes that if one option is false then the other option must be true.
  Since one option is presented as not true, the other is presented as the only possible choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The argument presents conditional reasoning (if A, then B).
  It concludes that Lester has received poor performance evaluation if he has not received a raise.
  The argument assumes that the absence of the one event must mean that the other event has occurred.

Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The principle given states that if an offer is not legitimate, it is not valid.
  Option B is consistent with the principle.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The principle stated in the question is about the validity of a contract based on the legitimacy of an offer when it is made. 
  The argument that most justifies the reasoning is the one where an offer is made that is not reasonably believed to be a jest.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The principle states that a legitimate offer is one that is not presented in jest and would be perceived by an unbiased party as a valid offer.
  If someone accepts an offer which has been made in jest, it is not considered a legitimate offer and thus there is no valid contract.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The principle states that a legitimate offer cannot be considered valid if a reasonable person would believe it to be made in jest. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if it is believed to be made in jest by the party to whom it was made.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The principle states that a contract is valid only if a legitimate offer is accepted by the other party. Also, the offer must not be made in jest to be considered legitimate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above specifies that an offer is not legitimate if someone reasonably believes the offer is made in jest.
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 
  Only argument B directly mentions that an offer is not legitimate because it was made in jest. This argument is describing a situation where one party accepts an offer they believe is legitimate but, in fact, the offer was made in jest. The principle stated supports the reasoning that the contract in this argument is not valid because the offer was not legitimate.
Response 7:
Thought:
The principle stated in the context informs about the condition when a contract is valid or not valid and suggests the test of a "reasonable person" to determine the legitimacy of an offer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone reasonably believes it to be made in jest.
  This principle is being used to assess the validity of an offer.
  We're looking for an argument where the principle is used to evaluate an offer as either legitimate or not.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option B is in line with this principle because Gus made the offer in jest, which is illegal.

Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that both kinds of horror stories share the two features, which are a description of violations of the laws of nature and the intention to produce dread in the reader.
  The passage does not mention that every description of monstrous beasts describes violations of the laws of nature.
  Although the author states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, the statement does not imply that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The question asks which statement MUST be true based on the given statements.
  We know that both horror stories about mad scientists and monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  Therefore, choice A, B, C, and D cannot be true because they are too extreme or not related to the given statements.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage states that both kinds of horror stories violate laws of nature and intend to produce dread in the reader.
  It does not make any statement regarding all descriptions of monstrous beasts, anti-scientific views, or psychological disturbance of characters.
  The passage also notes that horror stories about mad scientists express a view that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor.
  Choice B is inconsistent with the passage as not all violations of laws of nature are intended to produce dread in the reader.
  Choice E is consistent with the passage as some stories that employ symbolism may describe violations of the laws of nature.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and produce dread in the reader. 
  None of the statements provide information about both features. 
  Option A is too extreme and does not include the feature of being intended to produce dread in the reader that both kinds of horror stories share. 
  Option B is an extreme statement and does not cover the "type" of horror stories. 
  Option C is false; the passage does not provide information about the psychological condition of characters in horror stories, but only states that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
  Option D is outside the scope of the statements in the passage. 
  Option E is possible but is not directly related to the shared features of horror stories described in the passage.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. Both kinds share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread.
  The passage does not mention all descriptions of monstrous beasts, therefore, we cannot conclude that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  The passage only states that horror stories that describe a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader, which means we cannot conclude that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  The passage does not say that horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed, so we cannot assume that horror stories usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  The passage only mentions that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, so we cannot conclude that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  The passage states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Therefore we can conclude that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

Response 6:
Thought: 
  The paragraph describes the shared features of horror stories about monstrous beasts and mad scientists.
  The paragraph does not suggest that all descriptions of monstrous beast violate natural laws.
  The paragraph suggests that the violation of laws of nature is intended to produce dread in the reader.
  The paragraph does not mention anything about characters being psychologically disturbed in general horror stories.
  The paragraph mentions that horror stories about mad scientists express the idea that scientific knowledge alone is not enough.
  The paragraph suggests that horror stories utilize symbols.
  The answer that must be true should be connected to the two shared features of horror stories.

Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.
  C: The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
  D: The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey.
  E: The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that most citizens want a legislature that is 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  The argument is based on a survey where only 40% of respondents stated they wanted a Conservative legislature, 20% stated Moderate, and 40% stated Liberal.
  It is assumed that those who did not participate in the survey would answer similarly.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes about how a legislature should be based on survey results about political parties.
  The conclusion is that most citizens want a legislature that is 40% Conservative, 20% Moderate, and 40% Liberal.
  However, there could be a flaw in the reasoning of the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument makes a generalization from the survey results.
  No information is provided about the size of the sample or how it was selected.
  Therefore, it is unclear whether the survey results are reliable or not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument relies on survey results to make a conclusion.
  The conclusion assumes that the survey results are reliable. 
  Most citizens do not make up the surveyed group.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the respondent's stated preference translates to what they would like to see in the legislature.
  One cannot conclude most citizens' preferences based on a survey of only a subset of the population.
  The argument lacks evidence that the respondents' preference signifies a significant portion of the population.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The survey respondents' opinions may not reflect the opinions of the entire population.
  The survey may only be measuring general tendencies rather than firm preferences.
  The reasoning is unreliable if the participants are not a representative sample.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument draws a conclusion based on a survey result.
  The survey result is not accurately reflected in the conclusion because the conclusion is only a rough estimation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The survey results only express a group's party preferences but not individual members' preferences.
  The survey results do not indicate the degree to which each respondent supports each party.
  Assuming the most citizens means most individual members of the group may not be valid.
Action: Answer("C")

Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:

  The medical researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that contradicts the argument or provides evidence to the contrary.
  Option E might support the use of stretching in some cases.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The researcher argues that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries using a comparison of two groups with similar injury rates.
  The answer choice needs to show that stretching before jogging does help to prevent injuries or that the comparison is flawed in some way.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument concludes that stretching before jogging does not prevent injuries, based on the comparison between joggers who stretch and those who do not stretch.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find a piece of evidence that shows why the conclusion of the argument may not be true.
  Choice E is not helpful, as it applies to a certain form of exercise, but we are not comparing jogging to other forms of exercise.
  Among the remaining choices, only Choice B provides a reason why joggers who stretch may nevertheless incur injuries and thus weakens the conclusion. 
Action: Answer("B")

Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:

  The argument concludes that there are more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class, based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class but most psychology majors are not. However, it is still possible for there to be more psychology majors than sociology majors despite the unequal enrollment rates. 
  Option B presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning, where it assumes that because more residents are in favor of increased spending on roads than parks, that most residents must be in favor of spending more money on roads and opposed to spending more on parks.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors enrolled in the Introduction to Social Psychology class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the course while most of the psychology majors are not.

  We need to find the choice that has a flawed reasoning similar to the argument in question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:

  The argument presupposes that the number of psychology majors and sociology majors is roughly equal.
  It also assumes all sociology majors are taking the Psychology class.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The argument claims that the number or proportion of registered majors in a particular class is different from the number of registered students in another major.
This conclusion may be true, but the reasoning is flawed.
The argument rules out the possibility that psychology majors are taking different classes in psychology or sociology classes that are not offered this semester.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument above assumes that the number of sociology majors and psychology majors taking Introduction to Social Psychology is the same.
  Just because most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology and most of the psychology majors are not, it does not imply that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument presents a situation in which the majors enrolled in a sociology class and their number is used to conclude that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors in the class. 
  This flawed pattern of reasoning is an example of a similar argument in which a specific group is used to make a general conclusion.
  Therefore, the correct answer is choice B, in which a specific group (the respondents of an opinion poll) is used to make a general conclusion about most of the Silver Falls residents. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  The argument makes an assumption based on the number of students who are taking each course without considering the total number of students.
  It infers that the majority of students in the class are Sociology majors because most students taking the class, are Sociology majors. However, this isn't necessarily true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument assumes that the only reason that the psychology majors do not take a sociology class is because they are not interested in the subject. 
  Therefore, the argument makes an assumption about the reason why psychology majors are not taking the class.
  To determine the best match, we need to identify which answer choice presents a flawed pattern of reasoning that is most similar to the argument in the question stem.
